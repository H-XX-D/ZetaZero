Specifically, it contains two classes: `InstallWithStubs`, which is responsible for handling installation processes with stub files (`.pyi`), ensuring type hinting support during development; and `EditableInstallWithStubs`, designed to facilitate an editable install process while also incorporating the use of these stubs.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a function named `install_stubs()`, dedicated to integrating stub files into the project setup. This function plays a pivotal role in streamlining the installation procedure by automating the inclusion and placement of type hinting stubs for packages that lack comprehensive typing information within their source code. The purpose is to enhance developer productivity through better tool support without altering existing package installations.\n"}
