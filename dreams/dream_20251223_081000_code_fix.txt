 name the function, list parameters, add code if needed. To generate a useful insight or improvement, let's focus on enhancing the system's contextual awareness and efficiency by integrating a hybrid model that dynamically selects between different machine learning models based on the specific context. This approach can be particularly useful in systems that handle diverse types of data and tasks, such as ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM.

### Insight: Dynamic Model Selection

**Function Name:** `select_model`

**Parameters:**
- `context`: The context in which the model will be used.
- `data_type`: Type of data to be processed (e.g., text, numerical).
- `task_type`: Type of task to be performed (e.g., classification, regression).

**Code Example:**

```python
def select_model(context, data_type, task_type):
    """
    Selects the most appropriate model based on the given context, data type, and task type.
    """
    
    # Define model configurations
    models = {
        ('text', 'classification'): {
            '7B': 'model_7B',
            '14B': 'model_14B'
        },
        ('numerical', 'regression'): {
            '7B': 'model_regression_7B',
            '14B': 'model_regression_14B'
        },
        # Add more configurations as needed
    }
    
    # Determine the best model based on the context
    if data_type not in models or task_type not in models[data_type]:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported combination of data type and task type.")
    
    # Determine the best model based on resource availability and context
    if context == 'resource_constrained':
        selected_model = models[data_type][task_type]['7B']
    else:
        selected_model = models[data_type][task_type]['14B']
    
    return selected_model

# Example usage
context = 'resource_constrained'
data_type = 'text'
task_type = 'classification'

selected_model = select_model(context, data_type, task_type)
print(f"Selected Model: {selected_model}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Contextual Awareness:** The function `select_model` takes into account the current context (e.g., resource-constrained vs. resource-rich) to dynamically select between smaller and larger models.
- **Dynamic Selection:** This function can be integrated into the ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM modules to ensure that the most appropriate model is used for the
