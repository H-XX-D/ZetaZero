 Ensure the idea is unique and hasn't been mentioned before in this thread. To generate a novel insight or idea, let's dive deeper into the lesser-discussed areas of the codebase. Given that we already have a robust system like ZetaDynamicRouter routing tasks to specific models, one interesting area to explore could be enhancing the user experience through better context management.

**Idea: Contextual Query Enhancement Module (CQEM)**

**Description:**
The Contextual Query Enhancement Module (CQEM) would preprocess queries to enrich them with contextual information, thereby improving the quality and relevance of the responses generated by the models. CQEM would work by analyzing previous interactions, user history, and external data sources to infer and add context to each query. 

### Key Features:
1. **Context Inference Engine:** 
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify implicit context in user queries.
   - Analyze historical user interactions to build a personalized profile for each user.
   - Incorporate real-time context from external APIs (e.g., weather, news, calendar events).

2. **Enhanced Query Generation:**
   - Automatically generate enhanced queries that include inferred context.
   - For example, if a user has recently interacted about a specific topic or location, the system would include that context in the query sent to the model.
   
3. **Adaptive Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Continuously evaluate the relevance and accuracy of responses based on user feedback.
   - Use reinforcement learning to refine the contextual inference over time.

### Example Workflow:
1. User inputs a query: "What is the best time to visit Stonehenge?"
2. CQEM analyzes:
   - The user's location from their previous interactions (e.g., UK).
   - Recent queries or searches related to travel or tourism.
   - External data like current weather conditions or local events.
3. Enhanced Query: 
   - Sent to the model: "What is the best time to visit Stonehenge in England considering current weather and nearby events?"

### Benefits:
- **Improved Accuracy:** Contextual enhancements will lead to more accurate and relevant responses.
- **Enhanced Personalization:** Users receive tailored answers based on their history and current context.
- **Reduced Need for Follow-Up Queries:** The system proactively provides comprehensive information, reducing the need for users to ask additional questions.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather and store historical interaction data securely.
2. **Context Inference Engine Development
