 suggest line numbers and code modifications if relevant. Your suggestion should address one of the [improvement_needed] points.
To address the `parallel_processing` improvement needed, we can leverage Python's `concurrent.futures` module to parallelize certain operations, especially those that involve processing multiple branches or facts simultaneously. Given the context of `ZetaHRM` and `ZetaTRM`, let's consider a specific use case where we can parallelize the initialization process of these modules when dealing with multiple contexts or facts.

Let's assume that the `initialize_zetahrm_with_contexts` function is responsible for initializing multiple instances of `ZetaHRM` with different contexts. We can modify this function to parallelize the initialization process using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

Here is an example of how we can refactor the function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Assuming the following function signature:
def initialize_zetahrm_with_contexts(context_list):
    """
    Initializes multiple ZetaHRM instances with different contexts in parallel.
    
    :param context_list: A list of zeta_dual_ctx_t* pointers.
    """
    def initialize_single_zetahrm(dual_ctx):
        # Initialize a single ZetaHRM instance with a dual context.
        # This is an example placeholder for actual initialization logic.
        print(f"Initializing ZetaHRM with context: {dual_ctx}")
        return True
    
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize the initialization process.
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(initialize_single_zetahrm, context_list))
    
    return all(results)  # Return True if all initializations were successful.

# Example usage:
context_list = [zeta_dual_ctx_t() for _ in range(10)]
initialize_zetahrm_with_contexts(context_list)
```

In this example:
- We define a `initialize_single_zetahrm` function that initializes a single `ZetaHRM` instance.
- We use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the initialization of multiple contexts.
- The `executor.map` method is used to apply the `initialize_single_zetahrm` function to each context in the `context_list`.
- The results are collected and checked to ensure all initializations were successful.

This approach can significantly speed up the initialization process when dealing with a large number of contexts, thereby addressing the `parallel_processing` improvement needed.
