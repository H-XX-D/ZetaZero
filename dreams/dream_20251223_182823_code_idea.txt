Consider how confirmation bias might subtly manifest in the code, then propose an innovative technique to detect and mitigate it.
Based on the recent interactions, a novel insight could be related to how confirmation bias can subtly manifest in software code, particularly in decision-making algorithms or recommendation systems. Here's a specific and creative idea to detect and mitigate confirmation bias in such systems:

### Insight: Detection and Mitigation of Confirmation Bias in Recommendation Systems

#### Problem:
Recommendation systems often suffer from confirmation bias when they repeatedly present users with similar items based on their past choices, thereby reinforcing preexisting preferences and limiting exposure to diverse options. This can lead to filter bubbles and echo chambers, reducing the utility of the recommendations.

#### Solution:
To detect and mitigate confirmation bias in recommendation systems, we can introduce an innovative technique called **"Diverse Exploration Mechanism" (DEM)**. This mechanism periodically introduces diverse elements from a broader set of options to ensure that users are exposed to a wider variety of choices, breaking out of potential echo chambers.

#### Implementation:
1. **User Profiling**: Enhance the user profiling module to include not just past preferences but also interests inferred from less explicit sources (e.g., interactions with friends or similar users).
2. **Recommendation Diversification**: Introduce a score that penalizes overly similar recommendations. For instance, if a user frequently clicks on items from the same genre or brand, the system could adjust subsequent recommendations to include items from different genres or brands.
3. **Diverse Exploration Algorithm**: Implement an algorithm that periodically selects items from a broader set of options (e.g., items from different categories or those not typically favored by the user). This can be done through periodic randomized sampling or using techniques like Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation.

#### Example Code Snippet:
```python
import random

class RecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_profile = {}
        self.item_database = {}  # Contains item metadata including category
        self.confirmation_bias_score = {}  # Tracks confirmation bias over time
    
    def update_profile(self, user_id, interaction):
        # Update user profile based on interaction
        if user_id not in self.user_profile:
            self.user_profile[user_id] = {'preferences': [], 'confirmed_items': []}
        self.user_profile[user_id]['preferences'].append(interaction)
    
    def calculate_confirmation_bias(self, user_id):
        # Calculate confirmation bias score based on repeated similar interactions
        recent_interactions = self.user_profile[user_id]['preferences']
