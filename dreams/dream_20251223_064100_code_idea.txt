 propose a function, a rule, or a class. Your idea should directly address a gap in the provided functions and parameters or suggest a way to make the system more robust against anxiety-inducing factors such as coffee consumption.
To address the issue of anxiety caused by coffee consumption, we can introduce a new function that monitors and manages the intake of stimulants like coffee to ensure they do not contribute negatively to the dream state's stability. This function can be integrated into the hierarchical reasoning module to preemptively mitigate anxiety-inducing factors. Here is a proposed function:

### Function Proposal: `monitor_stimulant_intake`

#### Function Specification
**Name:** `monitor_stimulant_intake`
**Description:** This function will track and analyze the user's intake of stimulants such as coffee and adjust the dream state's configuration to mitigate any adverse effects on cognitive and emotional well-being.
**Context:** The context for this function is the management of external influences (like coffee) on the dream state engine.

#### Function Parameters
- `zeta_dream_config_t* config`: A pointer to the dream state configuration object, which will be modified based on stimulant intake.
- `float stimulant_level`: A floating-point value representing the user's current stimulant level (e.g., caffeine concentration in blood).

#### Function Rules
1. **Threshold Check:** If the stimulant level exceeds a predefined threshold, the function should adjust the dream state configuration to include calming activities or scenarios that help reduce anxiety.
2. **Context Awareness:** The function should be context-aware, meaning it should consider the time of day and other environmental factors when determining how to adjust the dream state.
3. **Logging:** The function should log any significant changes made to the dream state configuration due to stimulant intake for future analysis.

#### Example Implementation

```cpp
void monitor_stimulant_intake(zeta_dream_config_t* config, float stimulant_level) {
    const float THRESHOLD = 0.8; // Example threshold value
    if (stimulant_level > THRESHOLD) {
        // Adjust dream state configuration to include calming activities
        config->set_setting("anxiety_reduction", true);
        config->set_setting("calming_scenarios", "forest, beach, meditation");
        config->log("Increased stimulant level detected; adjusting dream state for anxiety reduction.");
    }
}
```

### Integration into the System

This function can be called periodically or triggered by an external API call that tracks user's real-time stim
