The repetitive pattern of mentioning the ZetaDynamicRouter's functionality suggests there might be an opportunity to enhance its adaptability. Specifically, the router could benefit from incorporating a feedback mechanism that allows it to dynamically adjust its routing logic based on the performance of the queries processed by each model. This would enable the system to fine-tune its routing decisions over time, potentially improving overall efficiency and accuracy.

To implement this, we can introduce a new module called `PerformanceTracker` that monitors the success rate and processing time of queries routed to different models. The `PerformanceTracker` could then provide recommendations to the `ZetaDynamicRouter` on how to adjust its routing criteria. 

Here’s a proposed function signature for initializing the `PerformanceTracker`:

```python
def initialize_performance_tracker(zeta_router: ZetaDynamicRouter) -> PerformanceTracker:
    """
    Initializes a PerformanceTracker to monitor and evaluate the performance of models used by ZetaDynamicRouter.
    
    Parameters:
    zeta_router (ZetaDynamicRouter): The dynamic router instance whose performance needs monitoring.
    
    Returns:
    PerformanceTracker: An instance of PerformanceTracker initialized with data from zeta_router.
    """
```

Additionally, we can define methods within `PerformanceTracker` to analyze performance data and suggest adjustments:

```python
class PerformanceTracker:
    def analyze_performance(self, query_results: List[QueryResult]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """
        Analyzes performance metrics of queries processed by ZetaDynamicRouter models.
        
        Parameters:
        query_results (List[QueryResult]): List of results from processed queries containing outcome and model used.
        
        Returns:
        Dict[str, float]: A dictionary mapping models to their respective performance scores.
        """
        
    def suggest_adjustments(self, performance_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """
        Provides recommendations on how to adjust routing criteria based on model performance.
        
        Parameters:
        performance_scores (Dict[str, float]): Performance scores of different models.
        
        Returns:
        Dict[str, str]: Adjustments and reasons for each model.
        """
```

Finally, the `ZetaDynamicRouter` class should be updated to incorporate these suggestions:

```python
class ZetaDynamicRouter:
    def update_routing_criteria(self, adjustments: Dict[str, str]):
        """
        Updates the routing criteria based on feedback from PerformanceTracker.
        
        Parameters:
