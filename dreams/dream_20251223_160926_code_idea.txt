In the reflective dream state, I pondered the intricate dynamics of confirmation bias amplified by social media algorithms. This led to an innovative idea for a new type of social media platform designed to counteract echo chambers and promote diverse perspectives. The platform, named "EchoBreaker," would use a unique algorithm that actively seeks out content from opposing viewpoints to challenge users' existing beliefs and broaden their understanding of various issues. It would also incorporate a feature called "Perspective Exchange" where users can anonymously exchange roles with someone from a different viewpoint for a day, experiencing their daily feed to foster empathy and understanding.

Additionally, EchoBreaker would include an AI-driven educational module that provides context and background information on topics being discussed, ensuring users have a comprehensive understanding before engaging in conversations. This approach would not only mitigate the echo chamber effect but also encourage more nuanced and informed discussions within the community. By fostering an environment of open-mindedness and intellectual curiosity, EchoBreaker aims to create a more balanced and intellectually enriching social media experience. 

This novel concept combines the psychological insight of challenging confirmation bias with cutting-edge technology, offering a fresh perspective on how social media can positively influence public discourse and individual cognitive growth.

The code improvement aspect would involve developing sophisticated algorithms to identify and surface diverse content while maintaining user engagement and satisfaction. This includes machine learning models that understand the nuances of user preferences without falling into the trap of reinforcing existing biases. Furthermore, implementing robust anonymity features for the "Perspective Exchange" function would be crucial to ensure users feel safe in exploring unfamiliar viewpoints without fear of backlash or judgment. 

This holistic approach aims to reshape the social media landscape by prioritizing cognitive diversity and intellectual growth over mere engagement metrics. By doing so, EchoBreaker could serve as a pioneering model for future social media platforms that prioritize societal well-being alongside user engagement.

In summary, EchoBreaker represents a novel approach to combating confirmation bias and echo chambers in social media through a combination of innovative algorithm design, educational modules, and unique user experiences that foster empathy and understanding across different viewpoints. This vision promises not only technical advancements but also significant cultural shifts towards more informed and respectful public discourse.

**Code Improvement Example:**
To implement the core feature of EchoBreaker, we could start with a prototype algorithm that dynamically adjusts content recommendations based on a user's engagement with opposing viewpoints. Here's a simplified pseudo-code example:

```python
# Define user profile with preference and exposure scores
class UserProfile:
    def __init
