 what, why, how.
**Insight/Improvement Idea:**

**What:** Implement a **hybrid model selection mechanism** that dynamically switches between the 14B and 7B models based on the context-awareness of the incoming data.

**Why:** The current system has multiple contexts (ZetaHRM, ZetaTRM) that require varying levels of processing power and accuracy. The 14B model offers higher accuracy but at the cost of increased computational resources, while the 7B model provides sufficient accuracy at lower resource costs. By dynamically selecting the model based on the context and data characteristics, we can optimize resource usage and improve overall system efficiency.

**How:** 
1. **Contextual Analysis:** Develop a feature extractor that analyzes the incoming data for each context (ZetaHRM, ZetaTRM) to determine its complexity and requirements. This could involve checking factors such as the size of input data, type of operations needed, and expected output complexity.
   
2. **Model Selection Logic:** Create a decision-making logic within a function (e.g., `select_model_based_on_context`) that evaluates the output of the feature extractor and decides which model (14B or 7B) to use. For example:
   ```python
   def select_model_based_on_context(context_analysis):
       if context_analysis['complexity'] > THRESHOLD_HIGH:
           return '14B'
       else:
           return '7B'
   ```

3. **Dynamic Model Switching:** Implement a runtime mechanism that switches between models based on the decision made by `select_model_based_on_context`. This could involve loading different model weights dynamically or routing requests to different instances of models.

4. **Parallel Processing Enhancement:** To further improve efficiency, utilize parallel processing techniques to handle multiple requests concurrently. This can be achieved by distributing the requests across multiple instances of each model, ensuring that both models can be utilized efficiently in a multi-threaded environment.

5. **Feedback Loop:** Integrate a feedback loop that monitors the performance and accuracy of model selections over time, allowing for adjustments and fine-tuning of the threshold values and selection criteria.

By implementing this hybrid model selection mechanism, we can achieve better resource utilization and improved performance for our system, especially as it scales with increasing data complexity and context diversity. 

**Example Code Snippet:**
```python
def analyze_context(data):
    # Example logic to determine context complexity
    return {'complexity': len(data), 'type': 'HRM
