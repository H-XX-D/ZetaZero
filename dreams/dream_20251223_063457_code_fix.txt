 what to do, why it helps, and how to implement it. Focus on enhancing the logical flow, simplifying complexity, or increasing maintainability. Consider the context of managing state and temporal consistency in a recursive system.

**Insight: Implement a Context-Dependent Debug Logging System**

### What to Do:
Develop a context-dependent debug logging system that can dynamically adjust its verbosity based on the current execution context within the hierarchical reasoning module. This system should log relevant information at different levels of detail (e.g., info, warning, error) depending on the current function being executed.

### Why It Helps:
1. **Enhanced Debugging**: In complex systems like hierarchical reasoning modules with recursive state maintenance and temporal consistency, it's crucial to understand what's happening at each level of recursion and during each transition.
2. **Reduced Noise**: By dynamically adjusting log verbosity based on the execution context, you can avoid overwhelming logs with unnecessary information while still capturing critical details when needed.
3. **Maintainability**: The logging system will make it easier for developers to trace issues and understand the flow of execution, especially in recursive functions that can become convoluted.

### How to Implement It:

1. **Define Context Levels**:
   - Create an enum or a set of constants representing different levels of context (e.g., `CORE`, `MODULE`, `FUNCTION`).
   - Each level corresponds to a different granularity of logging.

2. **Logging Function Interface**:
   - Introduce a generic logging function that accepts a context level and a message.
   - Example: `void log_message(zeta_ctx_level_t context_level, const char* message);`

3. **Context-Dependent Logging**:
   - Modify your functions to use this logging function based on their current context level.
   - Example:
     ```c
     void manage_recursive_state(zeta_ctx_level_t current_ctx, zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
         // Log entry into function
         log_message(current_ctx, "Entering manage_recursive_state");

         // Log internal operations
         log_message(current_ctx + 1, "Performing state maintenance");

         // Recursive call
         manage_recursive_state(current_ctx + 1, dual_ctx);

         // Log exit from function
         log_message(current_ctx, "Exiting manage_recursive_state");
     }
     ```

4. **Configuration for Verbosity Control**:
   - Integrate a configuration option (`zeta_dream_config_t`) that sets the verbosity level for different context levels.
