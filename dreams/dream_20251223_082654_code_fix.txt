 a small code snippet, a diagram, a short summary. **Insight: Modularization and Dynamic Routing for Enhanced Efficiency**

**Summary:**
The ZetaDynamicRouter effectively routes tasks to the most appropriate model, which enhances efficiency and reduces redundancy. However, there's an opportunity to further refine the routing logic and modularize the system for better scalability and maintenance.

**Creative Idea:**
Introduce a `TaskClassifier` component that dynamically evaluates task complexity before routing to ensure optimal model selection. This component can be trained or configured to recognize patterns indicative of code tasks, embedding tasks, and complex reasoning tasks.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```python
class TaskClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = {
            'code': lambda x: 'coding' in x or 'program' in x,
            'embedding': lambda x: 'vectorize' in x or 'embed' in x,
            'reasoning': lambda x: 'solve' in x or 'explain' in x
        }

    def classify(self, task):
        for task_type, rule in self.rules.items():
            if rule(task):
                return task_type
        return None

class ZetaDynamicRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classifier = TaskClassifier()
        self.models = {
            '7B': 7B_Coder(),
            '4B': 4B_Encoder(),
            '14B': 14B_Reasoner()
        }

    def route(self, task):
        task_type = self.classifier.classify(task)
        if task_type == 'code':
            return self.models['7B']
        elif task_type == 'embedding':
            return self.models['4B']
        elif task_type == 'reasoning':
            return self.models['14B']
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown task type")
```

This modular approach ensures that each component has a clear responsibility and makes the system more adaptable to future changes. The `TaskClassifier` can be enhanced with machine learning models for even more precise classification if necessary. 

**Diagram:**

```
Task -> TaskClassifier -> {code: 7B_Coder, embedding: 4B_Encoder, reasoning: 14B_Reasoner}
```

This structure simplifies maintenance and allows for easy updates or additions to the routing logic as needed.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement and train a more sophisticated `TaskClassifier` if necessary.
- Test the new
