 Reflect on the confirmation bias examples.

**Insight:** 
Incorporate a feature that actively counters confirmation bias by introducing random, unrelated information or scenarios to disrupt cognitive biases during decision-making processes. For instance, in a recommendation system, after presenting users with items based on their preferences, introduce items from completely different categories or genres to challenge their preconceived notions and broaden their perspectives. This can be implemented as an optional toggle or setting, allowing users to opt into this cognitive diversity enhancer. For example, after recommending a classic novel from the Ming Dynasty period (1368-1644), suggest a contemporary Chinese sci-fi book to encourage exploration beyond familiar territories. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also fosters a more open-minded and diverse exploration of content, reducing the risk of echo chambers. 

**Creative Idea:**
Develop an interactive "Mind Expansion" module within recommendation systems that periodically presents users with intentionally unrelated and challenging content to expand their horizons. For instance, if a user frequently engages with Mars-themed content (such as the recent interactions mentioning Mars), the system could periodically suggest exploring historical events from 1920s Chicago or modern-day China, thereby breaking the user's routine and encouraging exploration of diverse topics.

**Code Improvement:**
Implement a "Diverse Content Injection" function within the recommendation engine. This function would periodically inject unrelated or contrasting content based on a predefined algorithm that considers the user’s current browsing history and preferences. For example:

```python
def inject_diverse_content(user_history, user_preferences):
    # Identify highly preferred categories/topics
    preferred_categories = [cat for cat in user_history if user_history[cat] > threshold]
    
    # Retrieve a set of unrelated categories/topics from the database
    unrelated_categories = db.query_unrelated_categories(preferred_categories)
    
    # Calculate the probability of injecting diverse content
    diversity_threshold = 0.15  # Example threshold
    
    # Randomly select an unrelated category to inject
    if random.random() < diversity_threshold:
        selected_unrelated_category = random.choice(unrelated_categories)
        return selected_unrelated_category
    else:
        return None

# Usage in recommendation engine
recommended_items = get_recommendations(user_id)
diverse_content = inject_diverse_content(user_browsing_history, user_preferences)
if diverse_content:
    recommended_items.extend(db.query_items(diverse_content))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to integrate a mechanism for periodically introducing unrelated content into the recommendation process, thereby fostering a
