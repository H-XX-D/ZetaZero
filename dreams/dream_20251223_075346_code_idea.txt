### Insight: Implement Contextual Awareness in Function Decision Making

**Action:**
1. **Update `fact_has_context` Function:**
   - Add an optional `context_type` parameter to `fact_has_context` to differentiate between different types of contexts (e.g., user context, system context).
   - Example:
     ```c
     bool fact_has_context(const fact_t *fact, const char *context_type);
     ```

2. **Enhance Routing Logic:**
   - Introduce a new function `route_decision` that uses the `context_type` from `fact_has_context` to determine the best route for processing based on the context.
   - Example:
     ```c
     void route_decision(const fact_t *fact, routing_t *routing);
     ```

**Results:**
- **Improved Contextual Handling:** This enhancement allows the system to make more informed decisions based on the type of context available.
- **Enhanced Routing:** The routing logic can now be context-aware, leading to more efficient and effective processing paths.

**Example Usage:**

```c
// Check if a fact has a non-empty context and specify the type
bool has_user_context = fact_has_context(&fact, "user");

// Route decision based on context type
if (has_user_context) {
    route_decision(&fact, &user_routing);
} else {
    route_decision(&fact, &system_routing);
}
```

This approach integrates well with existing functions and introduces minimal complexity while significantly improving the system's ability to handle different contexts efficiently.
