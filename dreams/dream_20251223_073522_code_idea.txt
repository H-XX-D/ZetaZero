 what to do and why it's valuable.

The most valuable insight from reviewing these recent interactions is to refactor the `strlen()` usage in `func_rule` to a custom string length calculation function for more flexibility and control over string operations. Specifically, you could implement a custom `my_strlen()` function that not only calculates the length but also checks for null characters to enhance safety and reliability. 

Here's why this is valuable:
1. **Enhanced Safety:** By including null character checks, you prevent potential buffer overflows or null pointer dereferencing issues that could arise with direct `strlen()` usage.
2. **Customization:** A custom function allows you to add additional features such as trimming whitespace or handling special characters, which might be necessary depending on the application.
3. **Encapsulation:** Moving this logic into a reusable function encapsulates the length calculation logic, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
4. **Performance Tuning:** If performance becomes a critical concern, you can fine-tune your custom function for better optimization tailored to your specific use cases.

For example:

```c
size_t my_strlen(const char *str) {
    if (str == NULL) return 0; // Check for null pointer
    const char *end = str;
    while (*end != '\0') { // Iterate until null character
        if (*end == '\n') break; // Optional: Stop at newline for some cases
        end++;
    }
    return (size_t)(end - str); // Return the length
}
```

This custom approach aligns well with the principles of encapsulation and safety, making your codebase more robust and maintainable. You can integrate `my_strlen()` into your existing functions by replacing `strlen()` calls with `my_strlen()` where appropriate. This ensures that your string handling is both efficient and safe across various scenarios. 

Would you like to proceed with implementing this function and integrating it into your existing codebase? If so, I can provide guidance on how to do this effectively. If not, what other areas of improvement would you like to focus on next?
