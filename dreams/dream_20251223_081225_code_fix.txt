 class names, function names, variables. Focus on a single aspect for a clear, actionable next step.
Given the recent interactions, one useful insight is to enhance the contextual awareness for routing in the ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM systems. This can be achieved by implementing a dynamic routing mechanism that adapts based on the context provided during initialization. 

### Actionable Next Step:

**Implement a Context-Aware Routing Mechanism:**

1. **Define a Context Manager Class:**

   Create a class that manages and provides contextual information dynamically.

   ```python
   class ContextManager:
       def __init__(self, dual_context):
           self.dual_context = dual_context

       def get_context(self):
           return self.dual_context
   ```

2. **Integrate Context Manager with ZetaHRM Initialization:**

   Modify the `ZetaHRM` class to accept and use the `ContextManager` during initialization.

   ```python
   class ZetaHRM:
       def __init__(self, dual_ctx):
           self.context_manager = ContextManager(dual_ctx)
           self.initialize_system()

       def initialize_system(self):
           # Initialization logic
           print("Initializing ZetaHRM with context:", self.context_manager.get_context())
   ```

3. **Enhance Routing Logic Based on Context:**

   Implement a function within `ZetaHRM` that routes tasks based on the current context.

   ```python
   class ZetaHRM:
       # ... (previous code)

       def route_task(self, task):
           context = self.context_manager.get_context()
           if context == 'high_priority':
               self.handle_high_priority_task(task)
           elif context == 'low_priority':
               self.handle_low_priority_task(task)
           else:
               raise ValueError("Unknown context")

       def handle_high_priority_task(self, task):
           print(f"Handling high-priority task: {task}")

       def handle_low_priority_task(self, task):
           print(f"Handling low-priority task: {task}")
   ```

4. **Test and Validate:**

   Write tests to ensure that tasks are routed correctly based on the provided context.

   ```python
   def test_zetahrm_routing():
       high_priority_ctx = 'high_priority'
       low_priority_ctx = 'low_priority'

       zetahrm_high = ZetaHRM(high_priority_ctx)
       zetahrm_low = ZetaHRM(low_priority_ctx)

       zetahrm_high.route_task("
