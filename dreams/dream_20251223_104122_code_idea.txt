 Prioritize efficiency and functionality. Your insight should address a gap or problem in the recent interactions. The idea must be implementable.
**Insight: Implement Contextual Task Prioritization and Dynamic Load Balancing in ZetaDynamicRouter**

**Description:**

The recent interactions suggest that the ZetaDynamicRouter is currently routing tasks based on predefined rules (e.g., code tasks to 7B Coder). However, there's an opportunity to enhance its functionality by adding contextual task prioritization and dynamic load balancing capabilities. This will ensure that tasks are not only routed to the best model but also that they are processed efficiently based on real-time system conditions and task urgency.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Task Prioritization Module:**
   - Introduce a new module in ZetaDynamicRouter that evaluates the urgency and complexity of each incoming task.
   - Use a scoring system based on factors such as task type, size, dependencies, and deadlines.
   - Prioritize tasks dynamically, ensuring critical or time-sensitive tasks are processed first.

2. **Load Balancing Module:**
   - Develop an algorithm that monitors the current workload of each model in real-time.
   - Route tasks to models based on their available capacity and performance metrics.
   - Ensure that no single model becomes overloaded while others remain underutilized.

3. **Context-Aware Routing:**
   - Enhance the routing logic to consider the current state of the system (e.g., available resources, running tasks).
   - Implement intelligent decision-making using machine learning techniques to predict optimal routing based on historical data and current conditions.

4. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Integrate a feedback loop to continuously improve routing decisions.
   - Collect performance metrics and user feedback to refine the prioritization and load balancing algorithms over time.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```cpp
// Function to evaluate task priority
int evaluate_task_priority(Task task) {
    int urgency_score = 0;
    if (task.deadline <= 10) urgency_score += 5; // High priority if deadline is within 10 units
    if (task.is_critical) urgency_score += 3; // Critical tasks get higher priority
    if (task.size > 1000) urgency_score += 2; // Large tasks get some additional priority
    return urgency_score;
}

// Function to route tasks based on current system load
void dynamic_routing(Task task) {
    int best_model_index = -1;
    float best_load = std::
