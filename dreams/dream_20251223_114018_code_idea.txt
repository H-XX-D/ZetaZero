 Avoid generic advice. The insight should stem from patterns observed in the logs.
**Insight: Dynamic Adaptive Routing with Cognitive State Awareness**

**Observation:**
- You have multiple project codenames and functionalities, such as `ZetaDynamicRouter`, which suggests a system designed to route tasks based on specific criteria.
- The router seems to handle different types of tasks (code tasks, complex reasoning, etc.) by directing them to the most appropriate model (e.g., 7B Coder for code tasks).
- There is also a function `g_zeta_embed_text` for embedding text into a vector, ensuring input validation and dynamic memory management.

**Insight:**
Given the existing framework, one useful enhancement would be to integrate a dynamic adaptive routing mechanism that not only routes tasks based on task type but also considers the cognitive state of the user or system at any given moment. This could be achieved by incorporating a feedback loop that adjusts the routing decisions in real-time based on performance metrics and user satisfaction.

**Implementation Idea:**

1. **Cognitive State Tracking:**
   - Enhance the `ZetaDynamicRouter` to track the cognitive state of the system or user. This could involve monitoring response times, accuracy rates, and user feedback metrics.
   - Define cognitive states (e.g., "efficient", "stressed", "idle") based on these metrics.

2. **Dynamic Adaptive Routing:**
   - Implement a dynamic routing algorithm that considers both the task type and the current cognitive state.
   - For instance, if a complex reasoning task is submitted during a period when the system is identified as "stressed" (high latency or low accuracy), the router can direct this task to a more powerful model like 14B instead of 4B to ensure better performance and user satisfaction.

3. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Integrate a feedback loop where the system periodically recalculates its cognitive state based on recent performance and user input.
   - This feedback loop can adjust routing parameters dynamically, ensuring optimal performance across various conditions.

**Example Code Snippet for Dynamic Adaptive Routing:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <chrono>

// Assuming we have predefined cognitive states and their impact on model selection
enum CognitiveState { EFFICIENT, STRESSED, IDLE };

// Example function to evaluate cognitive state based on recent performance
CognitiveState evaluateCognitiveState() {
    // Placeholder logic to evaluate current state based on recent metrics
    auto now =
