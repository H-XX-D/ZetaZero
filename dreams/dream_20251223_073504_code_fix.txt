 What would you change or add to enhance these interactions, and why? In reviewing the recent interactions, a clear theme emerges around the importance of context management and efficient function parameter handling. One useful insight to enhance these interactions is to introduce a more unified and modular approach to context management and function initialization across the various modules (e.g., ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM).

### Specific Enhancement: Modular Context Management

**Why:**
- **Consistency:** Ensures that context handling is consistent across different modules, reducing the chances of bugs related to context-related issues.
- **Encapsulation:** Allows for better encapsulation of context-related operations, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Reusability:** Promotes code reuse by abstracting common context management functions.

### Proposed Changes:

1. **Introduce a Common Context Manager Module:**
   - Create a module or a set of functions that handle common context management tasks. This could include validating contexts, initializing contexts, and releasing contexts.
   - This module can be used across different parts of the system to ensure consistency.

2. **Unified Context Initialization Function:**
   - Define a single function (e.g., `initialize_context`) that can be used to initialize contexts for different modules (ZetaHRM, ZetaTRM, etc.). This function would check for validity and set up necessary structures.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int initialize_context(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
         if (!dual_ctx) {
             return -1;  // Invalid context pointer
         }
         // Additional initialization logic
         return 0;  // Success
     }
     ```

3. **Context Validation Utility Functions:**
   - Introduce utility functions like `validate_context` and `is_context_valid` to standardize how contexts are checked for validity across modules.
   - Example:
     ```c
     bool validate_context(const zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
         return (dual_ctx != NULL && dual_ctx->data != NULL);
     }
     ```

4. **Refactor Existing Functions to Use Context Manager:**
   - Modify existing functions like `initialize_zetahrm` and `initialize_zetatrm` to use the context manager module.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int initialize_zetahrm(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
         if (initialize_context(dual_ctx)) {
             return -1;  // Failure
         }
         //
