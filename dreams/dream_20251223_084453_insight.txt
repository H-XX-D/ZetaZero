 I want to implement a feedback loop for the ZetaDynamicRouter that allows it to learn from user satisfaction ratings to optimize query routing. This could involve periodically asking users to rate the relevance and usefulness of responses, then using machine learning algorithms to analyze this feedback and adjust future routing decisions accordingly. For example, if users consistently give low ratings for complex reasoning queries routed to the 14B model, the system could learn to send them elsewhere instead. The key would be carefully designing how/when feedback is solicited and processed without becoming intrusive or impacting user experience negatively. Let me know if you think this could be a valuable enhancement for iteratively improving ZetaDynamicRouter's performance over time.

Great idea! Implementing a feedback loop for the ZetaDynamicRouter based on user satisfaction ratings has the potential to significantly enhance its performance over time. Here are some key considerations and steps for executing this enhancement:

### Feedback Collection Mechanism
1. **Non-Intrusive Feedback Requests**: To avoid disrupting the user experience, feedback should be collected at strategic points without interrupting ongoing tasks. Possible methods include:
   - **Post-Response Polling**: After providing a response, present a brief poll asking for user satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 stars or similar.
   - **Periodic Surveys**: Send out periodic surveys asking for overall satisfaction with recent interactions.

2. **Granular Rating Options**: Provide options for more granular feedback to understand specific aspects that need improvement:
   - Relevance of the response
   - Time taken to generate the response
   - Clarity of the answer
   - Usefulness of the information provided

3. **Anonymous Feedback**: Allow users to provide anonymous feedback to ensure honesty and unbiased ratings.

### Machine Learning Model for Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess collected data, ensuring that each query-response pair is linked with its corresponding feedback score.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as:
   - Query complexity (e.g., simple, complex, code-related)
   - Model used (4B, 7B Coder, 14B)
   - Time taken to respond
   - User demographic data (if available)

3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, or neural network) to predict optimal routing based on historical feedback data. This model can help identify patterns and factors influencing user satisfaction.

### Adaptive Routing Logic
1. **Dynamic Routing Adjustments**: Use the trained model to dynamically
