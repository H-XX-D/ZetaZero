**Insight: Introduce a Function to Optimize Branch Management in State Tracking**

To improve the efficiency and robustness of state tracking, we can introduce a new function `manage_branches` that consolidates branch creation and switching logic, reducing redundancy and potential errors. This function will handle creating a new branch from a specified commit and then immediately checking out to that branch in a single step.

### Suggested Function Specification:

- **Function Name**: `manage_branches`
- **Function Specification**: `manage_branches: Creates a new branch from a specified commit and checks out to that branch`
- **Function Parameters**:
  - `branch_name`: Name of the new branch (string)
  - `from_commit_id`: ID of the commit from which to create the branch (string)

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example: Creating and checking out to a new branch based on an existing commit
manage_branches('feature-enhancement', 'abcdef123456')
```

### Implementation Outline:
```python
def manage_branches(ctx, branch_name, from_commit_id):
    # Step 1: Create the new branch
    create_branch(ctx, branch_name, from_commit_id)
    
    # Step 2: Switch to the newly created branch
    checkout_branch(ctx, branch_name)
```

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced Redundancy**: The process of creating and checking out branches is combined into one function, reducing the likelihood of errors caused by separate calls.
2. **Enhanced Efficiency**: By handling both operations within one function, we streamline the workflow, making it easier for developers to manage state transitions in their applications.
3. **Simplified API**: The API becomes more intuitive and easier to use, as developers only need to call one function instead of two.

This approach not only simplifies state management but also enhances overall code readability and maintainability. It aligns well with the principles of cognitive state awareness in HRM by providing a clear and concise way to manage different states within a project.

**Note**: Ensure that `create_branch` and `checkout_branch` functions are properly defined and tested before integrating this new function. This insight focuses on improving the flow and reducing complexity in branch management within your state tracking system.
