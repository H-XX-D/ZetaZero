485b93f | Implement a mechanism for the Dual-Process Cognitive Engine to dynamically allocate more resources from the 14B conscious to the 3B subconscious during complex problem-solving tasks, enhancing overall efficiency and adaptability. This could be modeled after the Git-style merging process, where resources are temporarily reallocated (like merging branches) to tackle specific challenges, then returned to their original states once the task is completed. This would create a more fluid and efficient system for handling diverse cognitive demands. To ensure stability, establish clear criteria for when and how much resource allocation occurs, akin to determining when merges should occur in a codebase. Additionally, incorporate feedback loops from TRM and HRM to assess task difficulty and adjust resource allocation accordingly, ensuring optimal performance. The subconscious could also contribute to task-solving by using parallel processing capabilities to run simulations or generate insights that are later integrated into the conscious mind for evaluation. This would simulate the branching and merging processes of a Git repository, allowing for the dynamic exploration of multiple solution paths before committing to a final decision.
Your idea is quite insightful and innovative! Let's break it down into a more structured [commit identifier] | [commit message] format:
