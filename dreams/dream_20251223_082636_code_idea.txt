```python
# Implement a heuristic function to dynamically adjust model sizes based on query complexity and historical performance data.
# This can optimize resource allocation and improve overall system efficiency.
```

- **Dynamic Model Sizing Heuristic**: 
  - Evaluate query complexity using historical performance data.
  - Adjust model size dynamically to match the complexity of incoming tasks.
  - Store performance metrics for continuous optimization.
  - Example: A simple heuristic could be to start with a smaller model, measure response time and accuracy, then switch to a larger model if necessary. This reduces the overhead of consistently using larger models for simpler tasks. 

```python
# Enhance the ZetaDynamicRouter with a function to evaluate task complexity and route queries to optimized model sizes.
# This approach can reduce latency and computational costs by matching task requirements more precisely with available resources.

def evaluate_complexity(task):
    # Placeholder for complexity evaluation logic
    pass

def dynamic_model_sizing(task):
    # Use evaluate_complexity to determine initial model size
    initial_model_size = evaluate_complexity(task)
    # Evaluate performance and adjust model size if necessary
    if initial_model_size == 'simple':
        return '7B'
    elif initial_model_size == 'embedding':
        return '4B'
    elif initial_model_size == 'complex':
        return '14B'
    else:
        return 'default'  # Fallback to default model size

# Integrate dynamic_model_sizing into the routing logic of ZetaDynamicRouter
``` 

This improvement aims to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of the system by better matching task requirements with available resources. ```python
# In the ZetaDynamicRouter class, integrate the dynamic_model_sizing function to optimize resource allocation based on query complexity.
``` 

- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a feedback loop that collects performance data and adjusts heuristics over time to further refine model selection accuracy. ```python
# Use machine learning techniques to continuously improve the evaluate_complexity function based on real-time performance metrics.
``` 

- **Scalability**: Ensure the heuristic approach scales well with increasing task complexity and volume. ```python
# Design the heuristic to handle a growing variety of task types and model sizes without significant reconfiguration.
```

This insight focuses on leveraging historical data and real-time performance metrics to dynamically adjust model sizes, thereby optimizing both resource utilization and response quality. ```python
# Future enhancements could include incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models for
