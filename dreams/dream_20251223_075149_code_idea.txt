 what, why, and how.
**Insight and Improvement:**
**What:** Implement a hybrid model selection mechanism that dynamically switches between 14B and 7B models based on the context of the request.

**Why:** This approach leverages the strengths of both models. The 14B model is more powerful and can handle complex tasks but is resource-intensive. The 7B model is lighter and faster, suitable for simpler tasks. By dynamically selecting the model based on context (e.g., complexity of the task, resource availability, and user requirements), you can optimize performance and efficiency.

**How:**
1. **Contextual Analysis:** Develop a function `contextual_analyze` that evaluates the request's complexity and resource constraints.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     int contextual_analyze(const Request& request) {
         // Evaluate request complexity and resource availability
         // Return 1 for 14B model, 0 for 7B model
         // Example logic:
         if (request.is_complex() && resource_available()) return 1;
         else return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Dynamic Model Selection:** Use the result from `contextual_analyze` to dynamically select the model.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     void process_request(const Request& request) {
         int model_choice = contextual_analyze(request);
         if (model_choice == 1) {
             // Use 14B model
             Model14B::process(request);
         } else {
             // Use 7B model
             Model7B::process(request);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism to refine the selection logic over time.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     void update_model_selection(const Request& request, const Response& response) {
         // Analyze response latency and user satisfaction
         if (response.is_satisfied() && (response.latency < threshold)) {
             // Update rules for better future selections
             update_rules(request, true);
         } else {
             update_rules(request, false);
         }
     }
     ```

This hybrid approach ensures that you can balance performance, resource usage, and user satisfaction effectively. It also aligns well with the need for contextual awareness and dynamic routing mentioned in your previous improvements. 

By integrating this mechanism, you can create a more adaptive and efficient system that leverages the best of both models based on real-time conditions
