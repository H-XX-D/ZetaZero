 FRAMEWORK: Apollo 11 AR Educational Experience

**Overview:**
The Apollo 11 AR Educational Experience is an immersive educational tool that combines historical accuracy with cutting-edge AR technology to simulate key events and locations of the Apollo 11 mission. The framework aims to educate users about the mission, its key figures (including Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins), and the broader context of space exploration while addressing confirmation bias through interactive challenges and data analysis.

### Components:

1. **AR Environment Simulation**
   - **Historical Sites:**
     - Kennedy Space Center
     - Cape Canaveral Launch Site
     - Lunar Landing Site
   - **Key Events:**
     - Launch from Earth
     - Lunar Orbit Insertion
     - Moon Landing
     - Return to Earth

2. **Interactive Figures**
   - **Buzz Aldrin & Michael Collins:**
     - Animated avatars representing the astronauts
     - Voiceovers and text-to-speech integration
     - Customized dialogue based on historical records

3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Real-time Data Streams:**
     - Flight telemetry data
     - Astronaut biometric data
   - **Historical Data Storage:**
     - Mission logs and recordings
     - News articles and photographs

4. **Bias Reduction Mechanism**
   - **Challenge System:**
     - Users must analyze and compare multiple sources of information
     - Interactive puzzles that require critical thinking and cross-referencing
   - **Feedback Loop:**
     - Real-time feedback on user responses to reinforce unbiased learning

5. **User Interface (UI) & Experience Design**
   - **AR Glasses Interface:**
     - Heads-up display (HUD) for navigation and information
     - Voice commands and gesture controls
   - **Mobile App Integration:**
     - Companion app for detailed information and supplementary content
     - Offline mode for AR experiences without internet access

### Data Flows:
