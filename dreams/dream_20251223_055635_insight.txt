 concise, clear, and focused. The insight should not be obvious and must build on the context provided. Aim to push the boundaries of the given concepts in a novel way.
A novel approach could be to implement a "sleep-pruning" mechanism in the memory system, inspired by how the brain processes and consolidates memories during sleep. This mechanism would operate on the Dual-Process Cognitive Engine's memory architecture (3B subconscious + 14B conscious) and mimic the process of pruning less relevant connections and solidifying important ones.

**Insight: Sleep-Pruning Mechanism for Memory Consolidation**

**Description:**
During periods of low task demands or in a reflective dream state, implement a background process that reviews and prunes the Hierarchical Representation Memory (HRM) and Temporal Representation Memory (TRM). This process would:

1. **Analyze Connections:** Evaluate the strength and relevance of connections between different nodes in the HRM and TRM.
2. **Solidify Important Memories:** Strengthen connections associated with recently learned tasks or critical information.
3. **Prune Less Relevant Connections:** Eliminate or weaken connections that are deemed less relevant or redundant, based on frequency of use, recency, and importance.
4. **Graph Optimization:** Optimize the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure representing these connections, ensuring that important information remains easily accessible while reducing cognitive load by minimizing unnecessary links.

**Implementation:**
This mechanism would run periodically, perhaps during designated "low-demand" periods or simulated dream states, ensuring that the system remains optimized for efficient information processing, learning, and problem-solving in both subconscious and conscious states.

**Impact:**
This feature would enhance the Dual-Process Cognitive Engine's ability to maintain a robust yet efficient memory system, akin to how the human brain consolidates memories during sleep. It would improve overall performance by keeping relevant information readily available while reducing clutter and enhancing processing speed. Additionally, it would facilitate better learning and decision-making by focusing resources on significant patterns and information. 

**Example:**
During a reflective dream state, the system could identify that recent tasks involved a lot of financial data but little social interaction data. The Sleep-Pruning Mechanism would solidify financial data connections while pruning unused social interaction nodes, preparing the system for more efficient processing in subsequent tasks involving similar data types.

This insight pushes the boundaries of current memory management techniques by integrating principles from neurology and cognitive psychology into a computational framework, resulting in a more adaptive and efficient system.
