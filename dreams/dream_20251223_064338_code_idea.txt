To address the issues identified and improve the design of the system, a useful insight is to introduce a dedicated class for handling context checks and anxiety management. Specifically, creating a `ContextAnalyzer` class to encapsulate the logic for determining if a fact has a specific context could streamline the interaction with the system. This class would handle the logic for checking if a cause like coffee leads to anxiety.

Here’s an example of how this might look:

```cpp
class ContextAnalyzer {
public:
    bool hasSpecificContext(const std::string& context) const {
        // Implementation to check if the fact has a specific context.
        // This could be as simple as comparing strings or more complex based on system needs.
        return (context == "causes_anxiety");
    }
};
```

Additionally, integrate a mechanism within `HierarchicalReasoningManager` to use `ContextAnalyzer` when evaluating causal relationships. This would involve adding a method such as `evaluateCausalRelation` in `HierarchicalReasoningManager`:

```cpp
class HierarchicalReasoningManager {
public:
    bool evaluateCausalRelation(const std::string& cause, const std::string& effect) {
        // Use ContextAnalyzer to check if the cause and effect have specific contexts.
        ContextAnalyzer analyzer;
        
        if (!analyzer.hasSpecificContext(cause)) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid cause context.");
        }
        
        if (!analyzer.hasSpecificContext(effect)) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid effect context.");
        }
        
        // Additional logic to determine if the cause-effect relationship is valid.
        return true; // Placeholder for actual logic.
    }

    void manageRecursiveState() {
        // Implementation for managing recursive state maintenance and temporal consistency.
    }
};
```

With this setup, you would ensure that any attempt to establish a causal relationship between factors like coffee causing anxiety goes through the `ContextAnalyzer`, ensuring that all checks are performed correctly and encapsulating the logic within the appropriate classes.

For better handling of temporal consistency and preventing infinite loops, you could also enhance the `HierarchicalReasoningManager` class to include methods for temporal state tracking:

```cpp
class HierarchicalReasoningManager {
public:
    void manageTemporalConsistency() {
        // Logic to manage temporal consistency and prevent infinite loops.
    }

    void initializeStateManagement(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
        // Initialization logic for hierarchical reasoning module.
    }
};
```
