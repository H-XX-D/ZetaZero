 The insight should relate to the concept of confirmation bias in a way that could be implemented in the ZetaDynamicRouter's decision-making algorithm. It could be about how the router handles code tasks or how it manages user interactions with the system, aiming to reduce confirmation bias and improve accuracy or user satisfaction.

**Insight: Implement Confirmation Bias Mitigation in ZetaDynamicRouter**

**Idea:**
To enhance the accuracy and user satisfaction of the ZetaDynamicRouter, we can integrate a mechanism that actively mitigates confirmation bias in its decision-making process. Specifically, when routing queries to different models (7B Coder, 4B, 14B), the router can incorporate a feedback loop that seeks out diverse perspectives and considers contradictory evidence.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Diverse Model Input:**
   - Instead of routing all similar queries to the same model (e.g., code tasks to 7B Coder), the router can occasionally send them to different models (e.g., 4B or 14B) for cross-verification.
   - This ensures that the router gets multiple viewpoints and reduces the risk of reinforcing preexisting biases.

2. **Contradictory Evidence Handling:**
   - The router can maintain a record of conflicting outputs from different models.
   - When such conflicts arise, the router can analyze these discrepancies to identify potential biases or inconsistencies.
   - The system can then aggregate these insights to make a more balanced decision, favoring evidence that is supported by multiple models.

3. **User Feedback Loop:**
   - After processing a query, the router can ask users if they noticed any discrepancies or if they would like to see an alternative solution from another model.
   - This user feedback can be used to fine-tune the router's decision-making process over time.

4. **Dynamic Bias Detection:**
   - Implement a mechanism to dynamically detect instances of confirmation bias during query processing.
   - If the router identifies patterns where it consistently favors certain models for specific types of queries, it can automatically adjust its routing strategy to seek out diverse inputs.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Query Type:** Code Task
- **Initial Route:** 7B Coder
- **Diverse Input Check:** Route a similar query to 4B Model for comparison.
- **Conflict Resolution:** If the 4B Model provides an alternative solution that contradicts the initial output from 7B Coder, flag this for review.
- **User Feedback:** Present both solutions to the user and
