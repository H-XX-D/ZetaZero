 don't just say "optimize performance," give details like "reduce redundant initializations in ZetaDynamicRouter." Focus on the provided interactions and the context of a system routing tasks to different models based on complexity. The idea should be directly applicable and actionable, enhancing the efficiency or effectiveness of the routing mechanism.
Given the repeated mention of the ZetaDynamicRouter routing code tasks to the 7B Coder model, one actionable improvement is to implement a caching mechanism for frequently requested code tasks. This can reduce redundant initializations and execution times, thereby enhancing performance.

**Detailed Idea:**
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implement a caching layer in the ZetaDynamicRouter to store the results of recently executed code tasks. If a similar code task is requested again, the router will first check the cache before routing it to the 7B Coder model. This ensures that commonly requested or repetitive code tasks are served faster without needing to reroute them through the 7B Coder model every time.
- **Cache Management**: The cache should be designed to handle different types of code tasks (e.g., by using hash-based lookups) and should include an eviction policy (e.g., LRU: Least Recently Used) to manage cache size and ensure that the most relevant tasks are cached.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Identify Code Task Patterns**: Analyze typical patterns of code tasks and determine which ones can benefit from caching.
2. **Integrate Cache Layer**: Add a caching layer within the ZetaDynamicRouter that intercepts incoming requests.
3. **Hash-based Lookups**: Use a hash-based structure (like a hash map) to store and retrieve cached results based on unique identifiers or signatures of the code tasks.
4. **LRU Eviction Policy**: Implement an LRU mechanism to manage cache size and evict less frequently used entries when the cache is full.
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance improvements and adjust the cache parameters as needed.

This approach will significantly reduce redundant computations, improve response times for frequently requested code tasks, and enhance overall system efficiency.
