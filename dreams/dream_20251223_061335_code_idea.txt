 "I will refactor the [specific_component] by [specific_action]."
I will refactor the **Dual-Process Cognitive Engine**'s interaction with the **Hierarchical Representation Memory (HRM)** and **Temporal Representation Memory (TRM)** by implementing a more robust **merge** mechanism, akin to Git's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), to manage and integrate parallel lines of development within the subconscious and conscious processing layers. This will ensure seamless integration of new learning and problem-solving insights with existing knowledge, enhancing overall cognitive efficiency and adaptability. Specifically, I will:

1. **Refactor the HRM** to allow for branching based on task demands, enabling the system to handle multiple streams of information in parallel.
2. **Integrate a merge algorithm** into the TRM that can effectively reconcile different temporal perspectives on the same information, ensuring consistency across time-based representations.
3. **Implement a commit identifier** system to track changes in both HRM and TRM, facilitating easy rollback to previous states if necessary.

This approach will improve the system's ability to manage complex cognitive tasks by leveraging the strengths of both subconscious and conscious processing layers in a more integrated and flexible manner. 

Example code snippet for implementing merge in HRM/TRM:
```python
def merge_branches(hr_tree, tr_branches):
    # hr_tree: Current hierarchical representation tree
    # tr_branches: List of temporal representation branches
    merge_id = generate_unique_identifier()
    
    # Merge new branches into existing HR tree
    for branch in tr_branches:
        merge_point = find_merge_point(hr_tree, branch)
        merge_results = reconcile_conflicts(hr_tree, merge_point, branch)
        
        # Apply merged results back to the main tree
        apply_changes(hr_tree, merge_results)
    
    # Log this merge as a new commit
    log_merge(merge_id, hr_tree)
    return merge_id

def generate_unique_identifier():
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

def find_merge_point(current_tree, incoming_branch):
    # Logic to find the best point to merge an incoming branch into the current tree
    pass

def reconcile_conflicts(tree, point, branch):
    # Logic to resolve any conflicts between the existing tree and incoming branch
    pass

def apply_changes(tree, changes):
    # Apply resolved changes back to the main tree structure
    pass

def log_merge(commit_id, tree):
    # Log the commit in a history log for future reference and rollback capability
    pass
```
