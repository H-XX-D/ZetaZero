 Ensure it ties the above concepts together.

The reflection reveals a sophisticated architecture for handling diverse tasks efficiently. One innovative enhancement would be integrating a dynamic model selection mechanism based on real-time cognitive state tracking. This feature can adjust the assigned model's complexity dynamically, ensuring optimal performance for the task at hand without unnecessary computational overhead.

**Proposed Enhancement:**

Introduce a **Cognitive Load Adaptive Model Selector (CLAMS)** module within **ZetaDynamicRouter**. CLAMS continuously monitors cognitive state metrics (e.g., task complexity, user engagement level, system load) and dynamically reassigns tasks to models of varying capacities. For instance, if a user initiates a complex reasoning task while the system is under low load, CLAMS could temporarily allocate resources to a more powerful model like 14B for enhanced performance, then revert back to a less resource-intensive model for simpler tasks.

**Implementation Idea:**

1. **Cognitive State Monitoring:** Enhance **ZetaDynamicRouter** to periodically assess cognitive state via predefined metrics or machine learning algorithms that interpret interaction patterns and system performance data.
   
2. **Model Performance Profiling:** Create a profile for each model specifying its optimal workload range and performance thresholds to guide dynamic allocation decisions.

3. **Adaptive Routing Logic:** Develop logic within CLAMS to intelligently route tasks based on current cognitive state and performance metrics, ensuring that resources are optimally allocated at all times.

4. **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback loop where the system learns from past decisions to refine its routing strategy over time, improving accuracy and efficiency.

This approach not only optimizes resource utilization but also enhances the overall user experience by ensuring consistent high performance across varying task demands.

### Example Code Snippet for Adaptive Routing Logic:
```cpp
void CLAMS::adaptModelAllocation(const std::string& task_type, const CognitiveState& state, ModelSelector& selector) {
    // Determine optimal model capacity based on current cognitive state
    int optimal_capacity = determineOptimalCapacity(state);
    
    // Select appropriate model based on task type and current system load
    Model best_fit_model = selector.selectModel(task_type, optimal_capacity);
    
    // Route task to selected model
    ZetaDynamicRouter::routeTask(task_type, best_fit_model);
}

int CLAMS::determineOptimalCapacity(const CognitiveState& state) {
    // Example: simple heuristic based on system load and user engagement
    int system_load = state.getSystemLoad();
    int engagement_level = state.getUserEngagement();
