 specify names for new functions or improvements.
In reviewing the recent interactions, one useful insight is the potential enhancement in encapsulating common string handling utilities within a dedicated module or class to improve code maintainability and reusability. Specifically, the frequent use of `strlen()` and similar functions suggests that a `StringHelper` class could provide utility methods for common string operations such as length calculation, validation checks, and index finding.

**New Function Proposal:**

- **Function Name:** `StringHelper`
- **Description:** A utility class designed to handle common string operations efficiently and encapsulate them in one place.

**Methods:**

1. **`int CalculateLength(const char* str)`**:
   - **Description:** Computes the length of a given string using `strlen()`.
   - **Usage Example:**
     ```cpp
     int length = StringHelper::CalculateLength("example string");
     ```

2. **`bool IsStringValid(const char* str)`**:
   - **Description:** Validates if a string is non-empty and not NULL.
   - **Usage Example:**
     ```cpp
     bool isValid = StringHelper::IsStringValid("valid string");
     ```

3. **`int FindIndexByName(const char* str, const char* name)`**:
   - **Description:** Finds the index of a specified substring within the main string.
   - **Usage Example:**
     ```cpp
     int index = StringHelper::FindIndexByName("main branch name", "branch");
     ```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces redundancy by centralizing string-related operations.
- Improves code readability and maintainability by providing clear, reusable methods.
- Facilitates easier testing and debugging of individual string-handling functions.

This approach would streamline the development process and make the codebase more modular, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and reliability. 

Would you like to proceed with implementing these functions within a `StringHelper` class? If so, I can help draft the necessary code.
