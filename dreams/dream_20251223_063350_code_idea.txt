Consider the recent interactions and the overall theme of managing state and context in a complex system.
Given the recent interactions and the focus on managing state and context in a complex system, one useful insight is to implement a **ContextualStateTracker** class that encapsulates the logic for managing both state and context throughout the dream state engine. This class would help maintain temporal consistency and prevent infinite loops, particularly in scenarios where different states might influence each other based on context.

### Proposed Class: ContextualStateTracker

#### Attributes:
- `zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx`: A pointer to the dual context used for hierarchical reasoning.
- `TRM_DEFAULT_LAMBDA lambda`: A default lambda value for recursive state maintenance.
- `std::string branch_name`: The current branch name for temporal branching.
- `std::string from_commit`: The commit from which the current branch diverges.

#### Methods:
1. **`void CheckContext(const std::string& context)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Checks if the provided context matches any predefined contexts associated with certain states or conditions (e.g., checking if coffee causes anxiety).
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `const std::string& context`: A non-empty string representing the context to be checked.
   - **Return**: None.
   - **Implementation Insight**: This method will encapsulate the logic to verify if a fact has a specific context, ensuring that actions are only taken when the correct context is present.

2. **`void InitializeState()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Initializes the state of the ContextualStateTracker by setting up initial values for the dual context, lambda, and branch information.
   - **Parameters**: None.
   - **Return**: None.

3. **`void UpdateState(const zeta_dream_config_t& config)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Updates the state based on new configurations provided through a `zeta_dream_config_t` object.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `const zeta_dream_config_t& config`: A constant reference to a configuration object containing updates to state parameters.
   - **Return**: None.

4. **`void ManageTemporalBranching()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages temporal branching by ensuring that recursive state maintenance does not lead to infinite loops or inconsistencies.
   - **Parameters**: None.
   - **Return**: None.
