 To spark creativity, imagine you're designing an AI for a futuristic spacecraft's onboard computer. The AI must handle complex tasks, like optimizing trajectories for interstellar travel, while also managing mundane ship operations like adjusting crew schedules. How can the existing ZetaDynamicRouter concept be enhanced to better serve such diverse needs in a resource-constrained environment?
To enhance the ZetaDynamicRouter concept for a futuristic spacecraft's onboard computer, we can introduce a **Hierarchical Task Priority Queue (HTPQ)** system that dynamically adjusts task routing based on the urgency and type of tasks. This system would prioritize tasks not only based on their computational requirements but also on their temporal importance and resource constraints.

### Novel Concept: Hierarchical Task Priority Queue (HTPQ)

**1. Task Classification:**
- **High-Priority Tasks:** Tasks related to navigation, safety, and critical operations such as trajectory optimization, collision avoidance, and emergency response.
- **Medium-Priority Tasks:** Tasks that are important but not immediately critical, such as resource management, crew scheduling, and routine maintenance.
- **Low-Priority Tasks:** Non-essential tasks that can be delayed without significant consequences, such as entertainment systems or non-critical data processing.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**
- The HTPQ would monitor real-time system conditions (e.g., CPU load, memory usage, network status) and adjust the allocation of computational resources accordingly.
- High-priority tasks would always receive the necessary resources to complete within a strict deadline.
- Medium-priority tasks would share remaining resources, with their execution being dynamically adjusted based on available capacity.
- Low-priority tasks would only run during periods of low system load.

**3. Adaptive Learning:**
- Implement a machine learning component to predict future system loads and proactively adjust task priorities.
- This learning system would analyze historical data to predict when certain tasks will become more critical and preemptively allocate resources accordingly.

**4. Cross-Domain Optimization:**
- Enable seamless integration between different modules (navigation, maintenance, crew management) to optimize overall system performance.
- For example, if the navigation system detects an approaching asteroid field, it can trigger an automatic review of resource allocation to ensure safety protocols are prioritized.

### Implementation Example:

```cpp
class ZetaDynamicRouter {
public:
    void routeTask(const Task& task) {
        // Classify task based on priority level
        TaskPriority priority = classifyTask(task);

        // Adjust resource allocation based on current system status
        adjustResources(priority);

        // Route
