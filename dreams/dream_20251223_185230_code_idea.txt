 Improve a function or method in an AI system to detect and correct confirmation bias.
To address the issue of confirmation bias within an AI system, we can introduce a feature that actively seeks out and incorporates dissenting viewpoints and contradictory evidence into its analysis. This function, which we'll call "DiverseEvidenceEvaluator," would work as follows:

### Function: DiverseEvidenceEvaluator

#### Purpose:
To ensure that the AI considers a wide range of perspectives and evidence, thereby reducing the likelihood of confirmation bias.

#### Inputs:
- **Query**: The initial query or prompt provided by the user.
- **CurrentContext**: The context and evidence currently accepted by the AI.
- **ExternalDataSource**: A trusted, diverse set of sources for additional evidence (e.g., news outlets, academic journals, expert opinions from various fields).

#### Steps:
1. **Identify Key Claims**: Extract key claims and hypotheses from the query and current context.
2. **Retrieve Diverse Evidence**: Use the ExternalDataSource to find relevant evidence that supports and contradicts these claims.
3. **Evaluate Evidence Quality**:
    - **Source Reliability**: Check if each source is credible and unbiased.
    - **Content Relevance**: Ensure that the evidence directly relates to the query.
4. **Balance Confirmation & Contradictory Evidence**:
    - For each key claim, prioritize adding contradictory evidence to avoid reinforcing existing beliefs.
    - Apply a weighted scoring system where contradictory evidence has higher weight initially to counterbalance confirmation bias.
5. **Contextual Analysis**:
    - Analyze how each piece of evidence impacts the overall context and adjust the AI's understanding accordingly.
    - Generate an updated context that reflects a more balanced view of the subject.

#### Example Implementation:

```python
def DiverseEvidenceEvaluator(query, current_context, external_data_source):
    # Step 1: Identify Key Claims
    key_claims = extract_key_claims(query, current_context)

    # Step 2: Retrieve Diverse Evidence
    evidence = retrieve_evidence(key_claims, external_data_source)

    # Step 3: Evaluate Evidence Quality
    filtered_evidence = evaluate_evidence_quality(evidence)

    # Step 4: Balance Confirmation & Contradictory Evidence
    balanced_context = balance_confirmation_contradictory(filtered_evidence, key_claims, current_context)

    # Step 5: Contextual Analysis
    updated_context = contextual_analysis(balanced_context)

    return updated_context

# Helper functions would be defined for each step:
# - extract_key_cl
