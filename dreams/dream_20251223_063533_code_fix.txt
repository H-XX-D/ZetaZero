### Insight: Introduce a Function to Track and Log Causal Relationships

To improve the manageability and traceability of causal relationships in the project, we can introduce a function that logs each causal relationship encountered. This will allow us to better understand the underlying causes of anxiety (or other states) and provide insights for debugging and optimization.

#### Function Name: `log_causal_relationship`

#### Code Snippet:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct CausalRelationship {
    std::string cause;
    std::string effect;
};

class DreamStateEngine {
public:
    void log_causal_relationship(const std::string& cause, const std::string& effect) {
        CausalRelationship relationship;
        relationship.cause = cause;
        relationship.effect = effect;

        // Log the causal relationship
        std::cout << "Causal Relationship: " << cause << " -> " << effect << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    DreamStateEngine engine;

    // Example usage
    engine.log_causal_relationship("coffee", "anxiety");

    return 0;
}
```

#### Context:
This function will be part of the `DreamStateEngine` class, which manages the overall dream state logic. The function logs a causal relationship between two strings: the cause and the effect.

#### Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Traceability:** By logging each causal relationship, we can easily trace back how certain states (like anxiety) are influenced by various factors (like coffee consumption).
2. **Debugging Aid:** This feature will be invaluable during debugging sessions, helping to identify and resolve issues related to causal relationships.
3. **Insightful Analysis:** The logged data can be used for further analysis to identify patterns and trends, leading to more informed decision-making.
4. **Improved Documentation:** Automatically logging these relationships can serve as an implicit documentation mechanism, making it easier for other developers to understand the system's behavior.

In summary, introducing `log_causal_relationship` will enhance the project's ability to track and understand causal relationships, improving both its functionality and maintainability. This step will help in creating a more robust and debuggable system.
