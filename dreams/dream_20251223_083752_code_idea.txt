 reference class names, variable names, functions, etc. To improve the efficiency and flexibility of the ZetaDynamicRouter system, we can implement a dynamic model selection mechanism based on query characteristics. This can be achieved by creating a `QueryProfiler` class that analyzes the input query and returns a recommended model size based on its complexity and type.

For example, the `QueryProfiler` class could have a method like `getRecommendedModelSize(query: str) -> int` which returns the most suitable model size (e.g., 4B for embedding tasks, 7B for coding tasks, or 14B for complex reasoning tasks).

To incorporate this feature into the ZetaDynamicRouter system, we can modify the `routeQuery` function to include a step where it calls the `QueryProfiler` to determine the appropriate model size before routing the query to the corresponding model.

Here's an example implementation outline:

```python
class QueryProfiler:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def getRecommendedModelSize(self, query: str) -> int:
        # Analyze the query and return the recommended model size
        pass

class ZetaDynamicRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.query_profiler = QueryProfiler()
        self.models = {
            "embedding": 4B,
            "coding": 7B,
            "reasoning": 14B
        }

    def routeQuery(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Profile the query
        recommended_model_size = self.query_profiler.getRecommendedModelSize(query)
        
        # Step 2: Determine the appropriate model based on query complexity and type
        model_type = self.determineModelType(query)
        
        # Step 3: Route the query to the appropriate model
        if model_type in self.models:
            return f"Routing query to {self.models[model_type]} model"
        else:
            return "Invalid model type"
    
    def determineModelType(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Determine if the query is for embedding, coding, or reasoning
        pass

# Example usage
router = ZetaDynamicRouter()
query = "Generate an efficient code snippet for sorting an array."
print(router.routeQuery(query))
```

This enhancement allows the ZetaDynamicRouter system to adaptively select the most appropriate model based on the specific characteristics of each query, improving overall performance and resource utilization. The `QueryProfiler` class provides a modular and extensible
