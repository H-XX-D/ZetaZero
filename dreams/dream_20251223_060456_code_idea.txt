 "I will add X feature that does Y."
I will add a feature called "Memory Consolidation Scheduler" that periodically reviews and consolidates the information stored in both the Hierarchical Representation Memory (HRM) and Temporal Representation Memory (TRM) components of the Dual-Process Cognitive Engine. This scheduler will analyze the parallel line of development represented by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure in the memory system, identifying redundant or outdated information and optimizing the overall architecture. By doing so, it will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of information processing, decision-making, learning, and problem-solving tasks within the system. Additionally, this feature will help to integrate and merge different branches of memory more seamlessly, ensuring that all relevant information is accessible for future use while maintaining a clean and organized memory structure. The consolidation process can be triggered based on specific events or after predefined intervals, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation of the cognitive architecture over time. The unique identifier for each consolidation task will be tracked, along with its parent commits, forming a comprehensive history of memory optimization actions. This approach will ensure that the cognitive engine remains optimized and adaptable to new challenges and experiences. 

Specifically:
- **Feature Name:** Memory Consolidation Scheduler
- **Purpose:** Periodic review and consolidation of HRM and TRM.
- **Functionality:**
  - Analyze parallel line of development using DAG.
  - Identify redundant or outdated information.
  - Optimize overall memory architecture.
  - Triggered by events or predefined intervals.
  - Track unique identifiers for each consolidation task.
  - Maintain a comprehensive history of memory optimization actions. 

This enhancement will significantly improve the performance and reliability of the cognitive engine's information processing capabilities. 

**Example Code Snippet:**

```python
class MemoryConsolidationScheduler:
    def __init__(self, hr_memory, tr_memory, consolidation_interval):
        self.hr_memory = hr_memory
        self.tr_memory = tr_memory
        self.consolidation_interval = consolidation_interval
        self.history = []

    def consolidate_memory(self):
        # Analyze parallel lines of development using DAG
        dag_analysis = self.analyze_dag()

        # Identify redundant or outdated information
        redundant_info = self.identify_redundant_info(dag_analysis)

        # Optimize memory architecture
        optimized_hr_memory = self.optimize_hr_memory(redundant_info)
        optimized_tr_memory = self.optimize_tr_memory(redundant_info)

        # Track unique identifier for this consolidation task
        task_id
