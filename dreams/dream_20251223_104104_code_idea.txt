 Aha! An interesting idea would be to implement a feature in the **ZetaDynamicRouter** that leverages context-aware routing based on previous interactions and current task characteristics. This could significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task handling. 

For example, instead of just routing tasks to models based on static criteria (e.g., complexity level), the system could dynamically analyze the nature of the current task in relation to recent tasks and the cognitive state of the user. 

**Idea: Context-Aware Task Routing**

**Implementation:**
1. **Context Analysis Module:**
   - **Recent Interaction Tracker**: Track and analyze recent interactions to identify patterns or recurring tasks.
   - **Cognitive State Sensor**: Continuously monitor the cognitive state of the user (e.g., mental fatigue, focus level, preferred interaction style).
   
2. **Dynamic Routing Logic:**
   - Based on the analysis from the Context Analysis Module, the ZetaDynamicRouter can dynamically adjust the routing strategy.
     - If recent tasks have been complex reasoning tasks, it might route similar tasks to a higher capacity model like 14B to ensure quality.
     - If the user is showing signs of mental fatigue, it might route tasks to models that require less cognitive effort from the user (e.g., simpler tasks to smaller models like 7B).
     - If there’s a pattern of code-related tasks, it might prioritize routing those to specialized coding models.

3. **Adaptive Embedding Function:**
   - Enhance `g_zeta_embed_text` to include contextual information (e.g., task type, user cognitive state) in the embedding process.
     ```cpp
     void g_zeta_embed_text(const char* text, const std::vector<float>& context_info, std::vector<float>& embedding, int embed_dim) {
         // Embedding function enhanced with context
         // Example:
         float* embedding_ptr = embedding.data();
         for (int i = 0; i < embed_dim; ++i) {
             embedding_ptr[i] = some_complex_embedding_function(text, context_info);
         }
     }
     ```

**Benefits:**
- **Personalized User Experience**: Tailor interactions based on the user's current state and recent history.
- **Resource Optimization**: Route tasks more efficiently by considering both task characteristics and user context.
- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Utilize higher capacity models only when truly needed, saving computational resources.

This approach would create a more intelligent and adaptive system that not only improves user satisfaction but
