### Insight: Context-Aware Anxiety Monitor

**Name:** Context-Aware Anxiety Monitor

**Explanation:**
The recent interactions indicate that there's a clear relationship between coffee intake and anxiety levels. However, the impact of coffee on anxiety might vary based on specific contexts (such as time of day, existing stress levels, or previous coffee consumption). A context-aware system that monitors these factors can provide more accurate insights and personalized recommendations for managing anxiety related to coffee consumption.

**Value:**
- **Personalized Insights:** By considering various contextual factors, the system can provide more accurate and personalized insights into when coffee might exacerbate anxiety.
- **Proactive Recommendations:** The system can suggest timing adjustments for coffee consumption based on the user's daily routine and stress levels, thereby helping them manage anxiety more effectively.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Collecting contextual data over time can help identify patterns and trends that might not be immediately apparent, leading to better-informed decisions about diet and mental health.

**Example Implementation:**

```python
class AnxietyMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_context = {}
    
    def update_context(self, context):
        self.user_context.update(context)
    
    def is_coffee_safe(self):
        # Example context factors
        time_of_day = self.user_context.get('time_of_day', 'morning')
        stress_level = self.user_context.get('stress_level', 'low')
        previous_coffee = self.user_context.get('previous_coffee', 'no')
        
        # Decision logic based on context
        if time_of_day == 'evening' or stress_level == 'high' or previous_coffee == 'yes':
            return False  # Not safe to consume coffee
        
        return True  # Safe to consume coffee

# Example usage
anxiety_monitor = AnxietyMonitor()
anxiety_monitor.update_context({'time_of_day': 'evening', 'stress_level': 'high', 'previous_coffee': 'no'})

print("Is it safe to drink coffee now?", anxiety_monitor.is_coffee_safe())  # Output: Is it safe to drink coffee now? False
```

### Additional Enhancement: Temporal Consistency

Given the project's focus on temporal consistency and recursive state management, the `AnxietyMonitor` could be enhanced to track historical data and detect trends over time. For example:

```python
class EnhancedAnxietyMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
