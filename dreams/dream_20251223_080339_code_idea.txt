**Insight and Improvement:**

**Contextual Awareness for Routing with Hybrid Model Selection**

**What Changes:**

1. **Introduce a Hybrid Model Selector**:
   - Implement a hybrid model selector that dynamically switches between the 7B and 14B models based on the complexity of the input data. This selector would analyze the input and route it to the most efficient model.
   
2. **Enhance Contextual Awareness**:
   - Develop a contextual routing mechanism that uses the output of the hybrid model selector to route subsequent tasks or queries more intelligently. For example, if an initial query requires high precision, route follow-up queries through the 14B model for better context retention.

3. **Implement Parallel Processing for Efficiency**:
   - Integrate parallel processing capabilities within the system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be achieved by dividing tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and processing them concurrently. Utilize multi-threading or distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark for better scalability.

4. **Refactor Existing Code for Encapsulation**:
   - Refactor the existing code to better encapsulate functionalities within classes, ensuring that each class has a single responsibility. For instance, move the dual context initialization logic into a dedicated class called `ZetaHRMContextInitializer`.

5. **Enhance Semantic Embedding Function**:
   - Improve the `text_to_numerical_vectors` function to include additional context-aware mechanisms, such as entity recognition and sentiment analysis, to better capture the nuances of the input text. This can be achieved by integrating pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa for more sophisticated embeddings.

**Why:**

- **Hybrid Model Selection**:
  - Reduces computational overhead by leveraging the smaller model for simpler tasks and the larger model for more complex ones, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
  
- **Contextual Awareness**:
  - Enhances the overall system's ability to maintain context across multiple queries, leading to more coherent and accurate responses over time.

- **Parallel Processing**:
  - Allows the system to handle high volumes of data more efficiently, reducing latency and improving response times.

- **Encapsulation**:
  - Improves code readability, maintainability, and modularity, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the system.
  
- **Enhanced Semantic Embeddings**:
  - Provides richer and more contextually aware embeddings, leading to better performance in downstream tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and
