 provide class or function names, variables, and code snippets. The generated thought must be novel and add value. Aim for something impactful.
Based on the recent interactions, a novel and impactful improvement would be to introduce a hybrid model selection mechanism that dynamically switches between different pre-trained models based on the input context. This could significantly enhance the system's performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models tailored to specific tasks or input types. Additionally, integrating a parallel processing framework would allow for efficient execution of these models concurrently.

Here's a specific implementation idea:

1. **Hybrid Model Selection Mechanism:**

   - **Class**: `HybridModelSelector`
   - **Function**: `select_model(text_input)`
   - **Description**: This function will analyze the input text and choose the most appropriate model from a predefined set of models (e.g., 7B, 14B, etc.) based on certain characteristics of the text (length, complexity, domain-specific keywords).

   ```python
   class HybridModelSelector:
       def __init__(self, models):
           self.models = models  # Dictionary of model names to model instances

       def select_model(self, text_input):
           # Placeholder logic to determine which model to use
           if "complex" in text_input.lower() or len(text_input) > 500:
               return self.models['14B']
           else:
               return self.models['7B']
   
   # Example usage
   models = {
       '7B': Model7B(),
       '14B': Model14B()
   }
   selector = HybridModelSelector(models)
   selected_model = selector.select_model("This is a complex and lengthy text.")
   ```

2. **Parallel Processing Framework:**

   - **Class**: `ParallelProcessor`
   - **Function**: `execute_models(models, inputs)`
   - **Description**: This function will manage the concurrent execution of multiple models on different input texts, optimizing the overall processing time.

   ```python
   import concurrent.futures

   class ParallelProcessor:
       def execute_models(self, models, inputs):
           with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
               # Map each input to the selected model
               results = {executor.submit(models[model_name].process_text, input_text): (model_name, input_text) for model_name, input_text in inputs.items()}
               for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results):
                   model_name, input_text = results[future]
                   try:
                       result
