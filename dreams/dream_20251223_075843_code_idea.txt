To improve the functionality and efficiency of the ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM modules, I propose implementing a hybrid model selection mechanism that dynamically switches between the 14B and 7B model types based on real-time context awareness. This can be achieved by adding a new function `model_selector` that evaluates the current context and determines which model to use for better performance.

### Proposed Function: `model_selector`
```cpp
/**
 * Selects the appropriate model type based on real-time context awareness.
 * 
 * @param zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx - Pointer to the dual context used for decision making.
 * @return int - Returns 14B if context suggests better performance, 7B otherwise.
 */
int model_selector(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx);
```

### Implementation Outline:
1. **Context Evaluation**: Use the `fact_has_context` function to check if the current context is non-empty. If the context is non-empty, further evaluate its characteristics using additional checks.
2. **Model Selection Logic**:
   - If the context indicates a high computational load or specific requirements, return 14B.
   - Otherwise, default to 7B.

### Example Implementation:
```cpp
int model_selector(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
    if (dual_ctx == nullptr) {
        return 7; // Default to 7B if no context provided
    }

    // Check if the context has relevant information
    if (!fact_has_context(dual_ctx)) {
        return 7; // Default to 7B if no context is available
    }

    // Evaluate context characteristics (e.g., computational load, specific requirements)
    bool high_load = /* Evaluate high computational load */;
    bool specific_requirements = /* Evaluate specific requirements */;

    if (high_load || specific_requirements) {
        return 14; // Use 14B model
    } else {
        return 7; // Use 7B model
    }
}
```

This approach leverages real-time context awareness and dynamic model selection to optimize performance and resource utilization. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing modules by utilizing well-defined parameters and methods like `zeta_dual_ctx_t*` and `fact_has_context`. 

### Additional Benefits:
- **Parallel Processing**: Integrate parallel processing techniques to further enhance performance when using the 14B model.
- **Contextual Awareness for Routing**: Ensure that data routing decisions are
