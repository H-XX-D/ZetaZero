 Name the functions and variables for the improvement. Include a concise explanation of how this would work. Ensure it ties into the concept of managing anxiety via coffee consumption.
### Insight and Improvement: Incorporating Feedback Mechanism for Coffee Consumption Impact on Anxiety

**Function Name:** `check_coffee_effect_on_anxiety`

**Function Description:** This function will evaluate the immediate effect of coffee consumption on anxiety levels, allowing users to make informed decisions about their caffeine intake.

**Variables:**
- `double anxiety_level_before` - Stores the user's anxiety level before consuming coffee.
- `double anxiety_level_after` - Stores the user's anxiety level after consuming coffee.
- `double time_since_coffee` - Stores the time elapsed since the last coffee intake (in minutes).
- `double coffee_dosage` - Stores the amount of coffee consumed (in mg).

**How It Works:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function is triggered when a user consumes coffee.
   - It captures the current anxiety level (`anxiety_level_before`) using a predefined method or sensor.

2. **Monitoring and Recording:**
   - After a specified interval (e.g., 30 minutes), another measurement is taken to determine `anxiety_level_after`.
   - The difference between these two levels is calculated and stored.

3. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - If the `anxiety_level_after` is significantly higher than `anxiety_level_before`, it suggests that the recent coffee consumption has exacerbated anxiety.
   - This information can be displayed to the user, along with advice on reducing caffeine intake if necessary.

4. **Temporal Consistency Check:**
   - The function ensures temporal consistency by preventing the same data point from being processed repeatedly and avoiding infinite loops via a mechanism similar to `recursive_state_maintenance`.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```cpp
void check_coffee_effect_on_anxiety(double& anxiety_level_before, double& anxiety_level_after, double coffee_dosage, double time_since_coffee) {
    // Capture anxiety level before coffee intake
    anxiety_level_before = get_current_anxiety_level();
    
    // Wait for a specified time (e.g., 30 minutes) before measuring again
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::minutes(30));

    // Capture anxiety level after coffee intake
    anxiety_level_after = get_current_anxiety_level();
    
    // Calculate the change in anxiety level
    double anxiety_change = anxiety_level_after - anxiety_level_before;

    //
