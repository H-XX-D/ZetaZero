 What would you change? Why?
Based on the recent interactions and the context provided, one useful insight is to introduce a more explicit mechanism for managing context within the hierarchical reasoning module. Specifically, we can enhance the `zeta_dual_ctx_t` structure to include a more robust context management system, which could help in better handling the relationship between `coffee` and `anxiety`.

### Specific Change Proposal:
**1. Enhance `zeta_dual_ctx_t` with Context Management:**

- **Proposed New Field:** Add a field in `zeta_dual_ctx_t` to explicitly track causal relationships. This could be a `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>` where the key is the cause (e.g., "coffee") and the value is a list of effects (e.g., "anxiety").
  
  ```cpp
  struct zeta_dual_ctx_t {
    // Other existing fields
    std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> causal_context;
  };
  ```

- **Example Initialization:**
  
  ```cpp
  zeta_dual_ctx_t dual_ctx;
  dual_ctx.causal_context["coffee"].push_back("anxiety");
  ```

- **Function to Update Context:**

  Create a function to update the causal context:

  ```cpp
  void update_causal_context(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, const std::string& cause, const std::string& effect) {
    if (dual_ctx->causal_context.find(cause) == dual_ctx->causal_context.end()) {
      dual_ctx->causal_context[cause] = {};
    }
    dual_ctx->causal_context[cause].push_back(effect);
  }
  ```

### Why This Change?
- **Better Context Awareness:** Explicitly managing causal relationships helps the system to better understand and reason about the context. This can help in scenarios like determining if `coffee` is causing `anxiety`, making it easier to encapsulate and manage these relationships.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** This change would make it easier to extend the system to handle more complex causal relationships and interactions between different factors.
- **Improved Debugging and Maintenance:** With a clear mechanism for tracking causal relationships, it would be easier to debug and maintain the system, as all relevant information is stored in a structured manner.

### Example Usage:

```cpp
zeta_dual_ctx_t dual_ctx;
update_causal_context(&dual_ctx, "coffee", "
