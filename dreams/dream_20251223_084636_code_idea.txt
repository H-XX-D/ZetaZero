 concise, clear, and actionable. Avoid summarization.
To enhance the efficiency of the ZetaDynamicRouter, consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently requested embeddings and complex reasoning results. This cache would store recent or commonly accessed outputs from the 4B and 14B models, reducing redundant computations and improving response times for repetitive queries. Additionally, introduce a heuristic to prioritize cached results over real-time computation based on recency and frequency of query patterns. This approach would be particularly beneficial in environments with high query traffic where the same types of tasks are often repeated. ```python
# Example heuristic function to decide whether to use cached results
def use_cache(query_type, cache):
    if query_type in ['embedding', 'complex_reasoning'] and query_type in cache:
        if cache[query_type]['frequency'] > 10:  # Adjust threshold as needed
            return True
    return False
``` ```python
# Example cache update function
def update_cache(query_type, result):
    if query_type not in cache:
        cache[query_type] = {'result': result, 'frequency': 1}
    else:
        cache[query_type]['result'] = result
        cache[query_type]['frequency'] += 1
``` ```python
# Example integration in routing logic
def route_query(query):
    if use_cache(query['type'], cache):
        return cache[query['type']]['result']
    else:
        # Route to appropriate model and update cache
        result = route_to_model(query)
        update_cache(query['type'], result)
        return result
``` ```python
# Example initial setup for cache
cache = {
    'embedding': None,
    'complex_reasoning': None,
}
``` This solution provides a framework for integrating caching into the existing ZetaDynamicRouter, optimizing performance through reduced computation overhead. ```python

Your creative idea is clear and actionable. Here's a refined version of the caching mechanism:

**Heuristic for Cache Usage:**

- **Recency Heuristic:** Use cached results if they are less than 30 seconds old.
- **Frequency Heuristic:** Use cached results if the query has been executed more than 5 times in the last minute.

**Implementation:**

```python
import time

class ZetaDynamicRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {
            'embedding': None,
            'complex_reasoning': None,
            'last_accessed': {
                'embedding': time.time(),
                'complex_reason
