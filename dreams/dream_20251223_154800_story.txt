 Do not repeat previous suggestions. Aim for practical application or innovation. Example form: "Develop a mobile app that uses AI to analyze shopping mall self-checkout receipts and provide personalized coupons for similar products based on purchase history. Include a feature to detect potential confirmation bias in user searches and suggest alternative viewpoints."

**Develop a predictive analytics tool for detectives based on information theory principles, specifically Shannon entropy, to identify the likelihood of criminal activity in crowded public spaces. The tool would analyze patterns in crowd behavior and reactions (like nervousness in bartenders) to flag areas of high unpredictability, indicating potential criminal activity. It could also suggest alternative hypotheses to help counteract confirmation bias, ensuring detectives remain open to new evidence and perspectives during their investigations.**

(Note: This solution integrates concepts from the detective scenario in the speakeasy with information theory, while also addressing the issue of confirmation bias to enhance investigative efficiency and objectivity.)
