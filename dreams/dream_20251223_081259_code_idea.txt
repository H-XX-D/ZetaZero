 class name, function name, and concise code example.

**Insight:**
To enhance the system's ability to handle context-aware routing and improve efficiency, we can introduce a hybrid model that combines both rule-based and machine learning approaches. This will allow the system to dynamically select the best model based on the context of the request, improving accuracy and performance.

**Creative Idea:**
Introduce a class `ContextualRouter` that manages the dynamic selection of models based on contextual information. This class can use a hybrid model selection approach to route requests to either a rule-based or machine learning model.

**Class Name:** `ContextualRouter`

**Function Name:** `select_model`

**Code Example:**

```python
class ContextualRouter:
    def __init__(self, rule_based_model, ml_based_model):
        self.rule_based_model = rule_based_model
        self.ml_based_model = ml_based_model

    def select_model(self, context):
        # Determine if context is suitable for ML or rule-based model
        if self.is_ml_context(context):
            return self.ml_based_model
        else:
            return self.rule_based_model

    def is_ml_context(self, context):
        # Simple example of context evaluation
        if "high_complexity" in context or "large_scale_data" in context:
            return True
        return False

# Example usage
rule_based = RuleBasedModel()
ml_based = MLBasedModel()

router = ContextualRouter(rule_based, ml_based)
selected_model = router.select_model("high_complexity_request")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`select_model`**: Determines which model to use based on the provided context.
- **`is_ml_context`**: A simple function that evaluates the context and decides whether to use the machine learning model or the rule-based model.

This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability in handling different types of requests, improving both performance and accuracy. The `ContextualRouter` class can be further extended with more sophisticated logic to handle a wider variety of contexts and improve model selection efficiency.
