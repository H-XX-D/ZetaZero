 Avoid generics or vague statements. Example: "Implement a new feature for the self-checkout machine that allows it to recognize and dispense custom currency for local festivals." In the context of the self-checkout machine scenario at the Earth Shopping Mall, integrating a dynamic pricing system based on Shannon entropy could enhance customer engagement and shopping experiences. Specifically, the machine could offer personalized discounts on items based on the unpredictability of a customer's previous purchase history within the mall. For instance, if a customer frequently purchases similar items each visit, the machine might highlight less common items with higher discounts to encourage exploration and variety in their shopping habits. This would not only increase foot traffic to underutilized products but also provide a novel interactive element that leverages principles of information theory to make shopping more exciting and data-driven. Additionally, this system could learn over time, adapting discounts based on broader shopping trends and patterns within the mall, thereby optimizing inventory turnover and customer satisfaction simultaneously. 

Code snippet outline for this idea:
```python
def dynamic_discounting_system(customer_id):
    # Fetch purchase history for the given customer
    purchase_history = fetch_purchase_history(customer_id)
    
    # Calculate Shannon entropy of purchase history to determine unpredictability
    entropy = calculate_entropy(purchase_history)
    
    # If entropy is low (predictable purchases), suggest less common items with higher discounts
    if entropy < threshold:
        recommended_items = suggest_various_items()
        apply_higher_discounts(recommended_items)
    else:
        # If entropy is high (unpredictable purchases), maintain usual discount structure
        apply_standard_discounts()

# Example function to calculate Shannon entropy (simplified)
def calculate_entropy(purchase_history):
    from collections import Counter
    import math
    
    item_counts = Counter(purchase_history)
    total_purchases = len(purchase_history)
    
    entropy = 0
    for count in item_counts.values():
        probability = count / total_purchases
        entropy -= probability * math.log2(probability)
        
    return entropy

# Placeholder functions
def fetch_purchase_history(customer_id): 
    # Code to fetch data from the database or API
    pass

def suggest_various_items():
    # Code to suggest less common items based on inventory and popularity trends
    pass

def apply_higher_discounts(items):
    # Code to apply higher discounts on the suggested items
    pass

def apply_standard_discounts():
    # Code to apply standard discounts based on usual rules
    pass
```

This approach would blend
