 names of variables/functions, parameters, and return values. This should enhance the system, making it more efficient, maintainable, or innovative.
Given the recent interactions, one useful insight to enhance the system is to implement a hybrid model selection mechanism that dynamically selects between the 7B and 14B model types based on the context and input data. This can be achieved by introducing a function `select_model` that evaluates the complexity and size of the input data to determine which model type is more appropriate.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the proposed enhancement:

### Function Specification
```cpp
// Selects between 7B and 14B model types based on input data characteristics.
// Returns a pointer to the selected model instance.
zeta_model_t* select_model(size_t input_size);
```

### Function Implementation
```cpp
zeta_model_t* select_model(size_t input_size) {
    if (input_size < THRESHOLD_SMALL_DATA) {
        // Use 7B model for smaller datasets
        return initialize_7B_model();
    } else {
        // Use 14B model for larger datasets
        return initialize_14B_model();
    }
}
```

### Contextual Awareness for Routing
In addition to model selection, we can enhance contextual awareness for routing decisions within the system. This can be implemented by modifying or extending the `fact_has_context` function to evaluate the context more comprehensively and route requests to the most suitable model.

```cpp
bool fact_has_enough_context(const fact_t* fact) {
    if (fact->context.size() < MIN_CONTEXT_SIZE) {
        return false;
    }
    // Additional checks based on context complexity
    if (is_complex_context(fact->context)) {
        // Route to a more powerful model
        return true;
    }
    return true;
}

// Example of is_complex_context function
bool is_complex_context(const std::string& context) {
    // Implement logic to determine if context is complex enough
    // For simplicity, consider any context with special characters as complex
    for (char c : context) {
        if (!isalnum(c)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Integration into the System
To integrate these enhancements, you would call `select_model` when initializing the system and use `fact_has_enough_context` to decide whether to route a request to a specific model type.

```cpp
int main() {
    zeta_model_t
