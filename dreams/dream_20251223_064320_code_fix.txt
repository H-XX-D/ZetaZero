### Insight: Introduce Contextual Validation for Function Parameters

**Context:**

In the recent interactions, there's an emphasis on managing contexts and ensuring that functions operate correctly under specific conditions. One recurring theme is the handling of parameters and their validation, especially in relation to the context. For example, the function `set_config` requires a valid `zeta_dream_config_t` object to ensure that the dream state engine operates correctly. Another instance is checking if a fact has a specific context, which implies that parameters must be validated to ensure they match expected criteria.

However, there is a missing component that would enhance the reliability and robustness of these functions: **contextual validation**. This means validating parameters not just based on their type but also based on their content and relevance to the current context.

### Specific Example:

Consider the function `set_config`, which configures the dream state engine. Currently, its parameter is a constant reference to a `zeta_dream_config_t` object, but there's no explicit validation of this object's content. For example:

```cpp
void set_config(const zeta_dream_config_t& config);
```

To improve this function, we can introduce a contextual validation mechanism that checks if the provided configuration is valid within the current context (e.g., checking if certain flags or settings are correctly set for a particular scenario).

Here's how we can implement this:

1. **Define Contextual Validation Rules**: Define rules based on different contexts (e.g., "development", "production", etc.). These rules could be implemented as enums or flags within the `zeta_dream_config_t` structure.

2. **Modify Function Signature**: The `set_config` function can take an additional parameter to specify the current context or can internally derive the context from some state variable.

3. **Validation Logic**: Implement logic to validate the provided configuration based on the current context.

Example Code:

```cpp
enum class DreamStateContext {
    DEVELOPMENT,
    PRODUCTION,
    TESTING
};

struct zeta_dream_config_t {
    bool debug_mode;
    int max_iterations;
    // other config settings
};

void set_config(const zeta_dream_config_t& config, DreamStateContext context) {
    bool isValid = true;

    switch (context) {
        case DreamStateContext::DEVELOPMENT:
            // Ensure debug_mode is
