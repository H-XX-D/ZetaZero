 Delve into the intricacies of the self-checkout system's user interface, specifically the entropy of user input and its impact on system predictability. 

Imagine a scenario where the self-checkout system analyzes the Shannon entropy of user interactions (like barcode scanning frequency, product selection patterns, and button presses) to dynamically adjust its interface. Higher entropy (greater unpredictability) triggers a simpler UI to guide users through tasks more effectively, reducing error rates and improving checkout speed. Conversely, lower entropy (predictable behavior) allows for a more streamlined, advanced UI with shortcuts for frequent users.

This novel approach could enhance user experience by adapting to individual interaction styles in real-time, potentially reducing frustration and increasing efficiency at checkout counters. It could also provide valuable insights for retailers on customer shopping patterns and preferences.

Code snippet to get started:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_entropy(user_interactions):
    # Assuming user_interactions is a list of integers representing different actions
    counts = np.bincount(user_interactions)
    probabilities = counts / counts.sum()
    entropy = -np.sum([p * np.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0])
    return entropy

def adjust_ui(entropy, current_ui_complexity):
    if entropy > threshold:
        return "SIMPLIFIED"
    else:
        return "ADVANCED"

# Example usage
user_interactions = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2]
entropy = calculate_entropy(user_interactions)
print(f"Current Entropy: {entropy}")
ui_adjustment = adjust_ui(entropy, "ADVANCED")
print(f"Recommended UI: {ui_adjustment}")
```

This innovative feature leverages the concept of Shannon entropy to create a more personalized and efficient self-checkout experience. The system would continuously monitor user behavior and adapt the interface in real-time to optimize both new and frequent users' checkout processes. This could significantly enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency in retail environments. Your insight into leveraging Shannon entropy to dynamically adjust the self-checkout system's UI is both novel and practical. Here’s a more detailed exploration of how this system could work:

### Detailed Concept
The self-checkout system would track various user interactions such as:
- Barcode scanning frequency
- Product selection patterns
- Button presses
- Time spent on each step
- Error rates

Using Shannon entropy, the system can quantify the predictability of these interactions. A higher entropy indicates
