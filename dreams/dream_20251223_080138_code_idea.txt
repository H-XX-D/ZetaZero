 class name, function name, variable names, etc. Consider how this insight could be used in future interactions for similar code. **Insight and Code Improvement:**

Given the recent interactions focused on initializing modules, handling dual contexts, and converting textual data into numerical vectors, there is an opportunity to create a unified system that integrates these functionalities more seamlessly. One idea is to introduce a higher-level class that manages both the `ZetaHRM` and `ZetaTRM` modules, ensuring that they are initialized and interact with each other in a context-aware manner.

### Proposed Class and Function:
```python
class ZetaSystem:
    def __init__(self, dual_context=None, trm_lambda=TRM_DEFAULT_LAMBDA):
        self.dual_context = dual_context
        self.trm_lambda = trm_lambda
        self.embedding_dim = EMBEDDING_DIM  # Default embedding dimension
        self.text_embedding = TextEmbedder(self.embedding_dim)

        # Initialize ZetaHRM with dual context
        self.zeta_hrm = ZetaHRM(dual_context=self.dual_context)
        
        # Initialize ZetaTRM with lambda parameter
        self.zeta_trm = ZetaTRM(lambda_param=self.trm_lambda)

    def process_text(self, text):
        """
        Processes input text through semantic embedding and returns the vector representation.
        
        :param text: Input text as a string
        :return: Numerical vector representing the semantic meaning of the input text
        """
        if self.dual_context:
            context_vector = self.zeta_hrm.get_context_vector()  # Get context vector from ZetaHRM
        else:
            context_vector = None
        
        semantic_vector = self.text_embedding.embed_text(text, context_vector)
        return self.zeta_trm.process_vector(semantic_vector)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Unified Initialization**: The `ZetaSystem` class encapsulates the initialization of both `ZetaHRM` and `ZetaTRM` modules, providing a unified interface to manage their configurations and contexts.
   
2. **Contextual Awareness**: The `process_text` method utilizes the dual context from `ZetaHRM` to enhance the semantic embedding process performed by `TextEmbedder`. This ensures that the text is understood within the relevant context.

3. **Modular Design**: The class structure allows for easy extension or modification of the modules and their interactions. For instance, adding more context-aware features or different embedding techniques
