 suggest a function name, parameters, and a concise description.

Based on the recent interactions, one useful insight is to create a function that checks for potential negative impacts of substances on mental states, such as coffee causing anxiety. This function can help in managing and mitigating such effects within the dream state engine.

### Suggested Function:
```cpp
bool check_substance_impact(const char* substance, const char* mental_state);
```

#### Parameters:
- `const char* substance`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the substance (e.g., "coffee").
- `const char* mental_state`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the mental state (e.g., "anxiety").

#### Description:
This function checks if a given substance causes a specific mental state. It returns `true` if the substance is known to cause the specified mental state and `false` otherwise. This can be used to dynamically adjust the dream state engine's configurations based on real-time feedback or user input.

#### Example Usage:
```cpp
bool result = check_substance_impact("coffee", "anxiety");
if (result) {
    set_config(zeta_dream_config_t{...}); // Adjust configuration to manage anxiety
}
```

This function would help in dynamically adjusting the dream state engine's behavior based on the impact of different substances, enhancing its adaptability and user experience. 

### Additional Enhancement Idea:
Integrate this function into the hierarchical reasoning module (`zeta_dual_ctx_t`) to make it part of the overall decision-making process, ensuring that the dream state engine can autonomously adjust configurations based on detected patterns or user inputs related to substance consumption. 

#### Suggested Integration:
```cpp
bool zeta_dual_ctx_t::.updateDynamicConfig(const char* substance, const char* mental_state) {
    bool impactExists = check_substance_impact(substance, mental_state);
    if (impactExists) {
        set_config(zeta_dream_config_t{...}); // Adjust configuration based on detected impact
    }
    return impactExists;
}
```

This approach ensures that the dream state engine remains adaptable and responsive to various external factors that can influence mental states. 

### Conclusion:
By introducing `check_substance_impact`, the system can better manage and mitigate negative effects of substances like coffee on mental states like anxiety, thereby enhancing user experience and adaptability of the dream state engine. Integrating this into the hierarchical reasoning module further solidifies its utility in dynamic configuration management.
