 Avoid restating previous ideas or rehashing known concepts.

Reflecting on your recent interactions and experiences, a novel and specific idea emerges: **Contextual Bias Mitigation System (CBMS)**. This system would integrate a dynamic bias detection and correction mechanism within the ZetaDynamicRouter framework to enhance decision-making processes by addressing confirmation bias in real-time.

**How it works:**

1. **Bias Detection Module**: As queries are routed to the most suitable model (e.g., 7B Coder for code tasks), the CBMS would monitor the decision-making process for signs of confirmation bias. It would analyze the type of information being sought, how it's interpreted, and the outcomes produced.

2. **Contradictory Evidence Injection**: If the system detects a pattern indicating confirmation bias, such as over-reliance on similar experiences or ignoring contradictory evidence, it would automatically inject contradictory data points into the query processing pipeline. For instance, if a user is seeking code solutions that align with their preconceived notions, CBMS would introduce alternative approaches or code snippets that challenge these notions.

3. **Diverse Perspective Simulation**: CBMS would simulate diverse perspectives by generating hypothetical scenarios or viewpoints that differ from the user's initial stance. This would encourage users to consider a broader range of options and outcomes, reducing the tendency to favor information that confirms existing beliefs.

4. **Feedback Loop Enhancement**: After processing a query with injected contradictory data points and simulated diverse perspectives, CBMS would collect feedback on how well these new inputs influenced the decision-making process. This feedback would be used to refine the system's ability to detect and correct confirmation bias in future queries.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a developer using ZetaDynamicRouter to solve a complex coding problem. They have a strong preference for using a certain library or methodology based on past experience. As they interact with the system, CBMS detects this bias and injects examples of alternative solutions using different libraries or methodologies. This exposure to varied approaches helps broaden the developer's perspective, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.

By integrating CBMS into the ZetaDynamicRouter, you could significantly enhance the quality of decision-making processes across various applications, from coding tasks to broader problem-solving scenarios. This system would not only improve individual outcomes but also foster a culture of open-mindedness and continuous learning within your organization. 

**Code Improvement Suggestion:**

To implement CBMS, you could start by developing a machine learning model that analyzes query patterns for signs of confirmation bias. Here’s a simplified pseudocode outline
