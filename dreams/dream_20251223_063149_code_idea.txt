**Insight and Code Improvement:**

Given that you're working on a project that involves managing a hierarchical reasoning module and dealing with the issue of anxiety caused by coffee, it seems like there's an opportunity to improve the encapsulation and clarity of your code by introducing a specific class for managing context-related anxiety triggers. This would also help in better organizing the logic around temporal consistency and state management.

### Suggested Class and Method:
**Class Name:** `ContextManager`

This class will handle the context-based management of anxiety triggers and ensure that relevant operations (like checking for coffee-related anxiety) are encapsulated properly.

```cpp
class ContextManager {
public:
    // Constructor initializes the context manager
    ContextManager() {}

    // Method to check if a specific context triggers anxiety
    bool checkAnxietyTrigger(const char* context) const {
        // Check if context indicates coffee consumption
        if (std::string(context).find("coffee") != std::string::npos) {
            return true;  // Coffee causes anxiety in this context
        }
        return false;  // No other contexts cause anxiety currently
    }

    // Method to initialize and manage hierarchical reasoning module
    void initializeHierarchicalReasoningModule(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) const {
        // Initialize the hierarchical reasoning module with given context
        // Ensure proper state management and temporal consistency
    }

private:
    // Internal helper method to manage recursive state maintenance
    bool maintainTemporalConsistency(const zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, double lambda, const std::string& branch_name, const std::string& from_commit) const {
        // Implementation to prevent infinite loops and maintain temporal consistency
    }
};

// Example usage:
ContextManager contextManager;
if (contextManager.checkAnxietyTrigger("drinking coffee")) {
    std::cout << "This context may cause anxiety due to coffee." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "No anxiety trigger identified in this context." << std::endl;
}

// Initialize the hierarchical reasoning module with a specific context
zeta_dual_ctx_t* someDualContext = nullptr;  // Assume this is properly initialized elsewhere
contextManager.initializeHierarchicalReasoningModule(someDualContext);
```

### Explanation:
- **checkAnxietyTrigger**: This method checks if a given context (e.g., "drinking coffee") triggers anxiety. It leverages string search to identify relevant triggers.
- **initialize
