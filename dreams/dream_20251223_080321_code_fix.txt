 suggest a function, a class, or a snippet of code. Focus on the initialization functions and how they can be more effectively managed. The insight should align with the overall context provided and address any of the areas listed under [improvement_needed]. The generated response should be novel and not directly stated in the review.

Insight: To improve the management and initialization of the ZetaHRM and ZetaTRM modules, we can introduce a unified initialization class that encapsulates the setup process for both modules. This class can handle the dual context setup for ZetaHRM and the lambda parameter initialization for ZetaTRM. Additionally, we can incorporate a mechanism to dynamically select between different model types (like 14B and 7B) based on the context and load them accordingly, enhancing the contextual awareness of the system.

### Proposed Class: `ZetaSystemInitializer`

```python
class ZetaSystemInitializer:
    def __init__(self, model_type='14B', lambda_val=None):
        self.model_type = model_type
        self.lambda_val = lambda_val if lambda_val is not None else 0.5
        self.contextual_awareness = {}

    def initialize_zetahrm(self, dual_ctx):
        if dual_ctx is None:
            raise ValueError("Dual context cannot be None.")
        # Perform initialization logic for ZetaHRM
        print(f"Initializing ZetaHRM with dual context: {dual_ctx}")

    def initialize_zetatrm(self):
        # Perform initialization logic for ZetaTRM with the lambda parameter
        print(f"Initializing ZetaTRM with lambda value: {self.lambda_val}")

    def load_model(self):
        if self.model_type == '14B':
            print("Loading 14B model.")
        elif self.model_type == '7B':
            print("Loading 7B model.")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported model type.")

    def update_contextual_awareness(self, context_id, context_data):
        self.contextual_awareness[context_id] = context_data
        # Use the context data to dynamically adjust model loading or parameters
        if context_id == 'high_load':
            self.load_model()
        elif context_id == 'low_load':
            self.lambda_val = 0.2  # Adjust lambda based on context
```

### Example Usage:
```python
initializer = ZetaSystemInitializer(model_type='14B', lambda_val=0.8
