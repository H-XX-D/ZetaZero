 Consider how to integrate information theory concepts into unexpected contexts.

Creative Idea:
Integrate Shannon entropy into a novel social media feature called "Perspective Shift". This feature would periodically expose users to diverse viewpoints that are outside their typical echo chamber. By quantifying the entropy of a user's content feed, the platform could identify low entropy states (i.e., highly predictable and homogeneous content) and introduce elements of higher entropy (i.e., diverse and surprising content). This would be done through a subtle, randomized algorithm that ensures the user is still primarily exposed to their interests but with a periodic injection of novelty.

The algorithm would work as follows:
1. **Calculate Feed Entropy**: Use Shannon entropy to measure the diversity and unpredictability of content in a user's feed over a given period.
2. **Identify Echo Chambers**: If the feed entropy falls below a certain threshold, flag it as an echo chamber.
3. **Diverse Content Injection**: When an echo chamber is detected, the algorithm would select and inject content from various sources that represent different perspectives and topics, thereby increasing feed entropy.
4. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback system where users can rate how novel or insightful the injected content was, which helps refine future content selections.
5. **Gradual Introduction**: To avoid overwhelming users, the novelty content would be introduced gradually, ensuring it does not significantly alter the user's primary content consumption habits.

This approach not only leverages information theory to enhance user experience but also addresses the societal issue of confirmation bias in social media ecosystems. The periodic introduction of diverse viewpoints fosters critical thinking and broadens horizons without disrupting the user's preferred content consumption patterns. This feature could be marketed as a tool for personal growth and mental stimulation, positioning the social media platform as a leader in promoting balanced and informed discussions. ```pseudo
function calculateFeedEntropy(userFeed) {
    let uniqueContentTypes = new Set(userFeed.map(item => item.contentType));
    let probabilities = userFeed.reduce((acc, item) => {
        acc[item.contentType] = (acc[item.contentType] || 0) + 1;
        return acc;
    }, {});

    let entropySum = 0;
    uniqueContentTypes.forEach(contentType => {
        let probability = probabilities[contentType] / userFeed.length;
        entropySum += -probability * Math.log2(probability);
    });

    return entropySum;
}

function identifyEchoChamber(feedEntropy) {
    if (feedEntropy < ECHO_CHAMBER_THRESHOLD) {
        return true;
