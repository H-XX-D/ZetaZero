 mention functions, parameters, and their relations. Consider the project's overarching goal. Aim for something that could have a significant positive impact, but is not too complex to implement.
To improve the overall project's cohesion and functionality, consider integrating a mechanism to dynamically adjust the lambda parameter in the `set_config` function based on the current context of anxiety levels. This would allow the system to adaptively manage recursive state maintenance and temporal consistency more effectively in response to varying levels of anxiety caused by factors like coffee consumption.

### Proposed Improvement:

**Function: `adjust_lambda_based_on_anxiety`**

**Description:**
This function will take the current context of anxiety as input and dynamically adjust the lambda parameter used in recursive state maintenance and temporal consistency checks. This adjustment can help mitigate issues related to increased anxiety by fine-tuning how frequently or deeply recursive checks are performed, thereby preventing potential infinite loops or overly aggressive state changes during high-stress periods.

**Relation to Existing Components:**

1. **Integration with `set_config`:** Modify the `set_config` function to accept an additional parameter (e.g., `anxiety_level`) that influences the lambda value. This can be done through an existing context mechanism or by introducing a new one that tracks anxiety levels over time.

2. **Impact on Recursive State Maintenance:** Adjusting lambda dynamically would directly influence how often recursive checks are performed, allowing the system to be more responsive to changes in stress levels without risking instability.

3. **Temporal Consistency:** Ensuring temporal consistency during times of higher anxiety (caused by factors like coffee) would be crucial. Dynamic lambda adjustment helps maintain this consistency by adapting recursion depth and frequency based on real-time anxiety data.

### Implementation Details:

- **Parameter Definition:** Define a new parameter in the `set_config` function signature to accept `anxiety_level` (or similar) as input.
  
- **Context Monitoring:** Implement a lightweight mechanism to monitor and periodically update the `anxiety_level` based on user inputs, sensor data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance), or other relevant indicators.

- **Lambda Adjustment Logic:** Create logic within `adjust_lambda_based_on_anxiety` to adjust lambda values based on predefined thresholds or algorithms correlating anxiety levels with optimal recursion parameters.

### Example Code Snippet:

```cpp
void adjust_lambda_based_on_anxiety(float anxiety_level, double& lambda) {
    if (anxiety_level > HIGH_STRESS_THRESHOLD) {
        lambda = LOW_LAMBDA; // Decrease recursion frequency to prevent infinite loops
