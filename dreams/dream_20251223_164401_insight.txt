 Reflect on the confirmation bias data and suggest a unique way to mitigate its impact in user interactions. 

Example response:
Reflecting on the recent interactions and the recurring mention of confirmation bias, a novel approach could be to implement a feature that suggests opposing viewpoints or contradictory evidence based on the user's query or previous interactions. For instance, if a user engages with information about the Apollo 11 mission launch, the system could also offer content that questions certain aspects of the mission, such as conspiracy theories or alternative explanations, while clearly labeling them as such. This would encourage users to consider multiple perspectives and reduce their reliance on information that solely confirms their existing beliefs. Additionally, this feature could be integrated into educational platforms to foster critical thinking and a more nuanced understanding of historical events.

Reflecting on the recent interactions and the recurring mention of confirmation bias, a novel approach could be to implement a feature called "Perspective Switcher." This feature would periodically present users with information from a contrasting viewpoint or contextually related but divergent sources.

For example, if a user interacts with information about the Apollo 11 mission launch from Kennedy Space Center, the system could intermittently present them with details about another space mission that faced significant challenges or failures. Or, if they engage with content about China's Great Wall, the system could occasionally provide insights into other ancient civilizations' monumental constructions and their unique features and controversies.

By doing this, users are encouraged to explore and compare different narratives and sources, which can help reduce confirmation bias. This feature would work especially well in educational or research contexts, enhancing critical thinking skills and fostering a more holistic understanding of topics.

Moreover, the "Perspective Switcher" could be designed as an adjustable setting within the user's profile. Users can toggle on/off or set frequency levels for how often they receive contrasting viewpoints. This allows for personalization based on user preferences while still promoting cognitive flexibility and exposure to diverse perspectives.

In summary, integrating the "Perspective Switcher" feature would address confirmation bias by actively engaging users with alternative narratives and viewpoints, thereby enriching their comprehension and analytical skills in various domains. This approach encourages open-mindedness and reduces reliance on pre-existing biases when processing information. ```pseudo-code
if (user.interacts_with(content)) {
  if (random.nextBoolean(0.25)) { // 25% chance of switching perspective
    alternative_content = generate_contrasting_viewpoint(content);
    present(user, alternative_content);
  }
}
```

This pseudo-code demonstrates a simple way to implement the feature
