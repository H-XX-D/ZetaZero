**[Project_Codename]: ZetaDynamicRouter**

**[Functionality]:** Implement a dynamic load balancing mechanism for the ZetaDynamicRouter. This would allow the router to not only route queries to the best model based on task type (simple, complex reasoning, embedding tasks) but also dynamically adjust to the load on each model.

**[Task_Routing]:** 
1. **Simple Queries**: Currently routed to 7B model.
2. **Embedding Tasks**: Currently routed to 4B model.
3. **Complex Reasoning**: Currently routed to 14B model.

**[Improvement_Suggestion]:**
- Introduce a monitoring component that tracks the current load and performance of each model.
- Route tasks not only based on their type but also on the current load of each model. For example, if the 7B model is currently under heavy load, reroute some simple queries to less busy models (e.g., 4B or 14B) temporarily.
- Implement a feedback loop where the system learns from past routing decisions and adjusts the load distribution over time to optimize performance and resource utilization.

**[Code_Improvement_Idea]:**
- Develop an adaptive algorithm within the ZetaDynamicRouter that periodically assesses the workload on each model and adjusts routing decisions based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., response time, CPU usage, memory consumption).

**[Creative_Idea]:**
- **Cognitive State Tracking Enhancements:** Integrate advanced monitoring features that track not just the load but also the cognitive state of the models. This includes tracking factors like accuracy degradation over time, memory leaks, and general health. Use this data to dynamically adjust routing rules to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

This improvement would enhance the robustness and efficiency of the ZetaDynamicRouter by ensuring optimal utilization of resources and maintaining consistent performance across all query types.
