### Insight and Improvement: Contextual Awareness for Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
In the interactions, it was noted that the `ZetaHRM` and `ZetaTRM` modules use context-based initialization with different parameters (`dual_ctx_t` for HRM and a lambda parameter for TRM). Given this setup, we can enhance these modules by implementing a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism based on contextual awareness.

#### Proposed Feature: Contextual Parameter Adjustment
**Function: `adjust_parameters_based_on_context`**

This new feature will dynamically adjust parameters of `ZetaHRM` and `ZetaTRM` based on the provided context, thus making the modules more adaptable and context-aware.

##### Implementation Details:
1. **Function Definition:**
   - **Function Name:** `adjust_parameters_based_on_context`
   - **Parameters:**
     - `zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx` - The dual context pointer provided during the initialization of `ZetaHRM`.
     - `float lambda` - The lambda parameter used during the initialization of `ZetaTRM`.
   - **Return Type:** `void`

2. **Function Logic:**
   - The function will analyze the `dual_ctx` and `lambda` values to determine if any dynamic adjustments are necessary.
   - For example, if the context suggests a specific environment or operational mode, the function can adjust parameters to optimize performance or resource usage.
   
3. **Integration with Existing Modules:**
   - This function will be called periodically or triggered by events within the modules to ensure that the parameters are always optimized based on the latest context.

4. **Example Usage:**
   ```cpp
   void adjust_parameters_based_on_context(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, float lambda) {
       // Analyze dual_ctx and lambda to decide on adjustments
       if (/* condition based on dual_ctx */) {
           // Adjust HRM parameters accordingly
       }
       
       if (/* condition based on lambda */) {
           // Adjust TRM parameters accordingly
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Benefits:**
   - **Improved Adaptability:** The modules will be more adaptable to different contexts, leading to better performance and resource utilization.
   - **Enhanced Robustness:** By dynamically adjusting parameters based on context, the system can handle a wider range of scenarios efficiently.
   - **Optimization:** This feature allows for fine-tuning of parameters without manual intervention, potentially leading to performance improvements and cost savings.
