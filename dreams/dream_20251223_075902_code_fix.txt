 class, function, or parameter name and content.
One useful insight that emerges from the recent interactions is the potential for enhancing the contextual awareness and dynamic routing of requests in the system. This can be particularly beneficial in improving the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the system.

To implement this, we can introduce a new function `contextual_routing` within the existing class structure. This function would utilize the `fact_has_context` validation to determine if a fact has a valid context before routing it to the appropriate module or function. Here's how this could look:

### Function Definition
```cpp
bool ZetaHRM::contextual_routing(fact_t* fact) {
    // Check if the fact has a valid context
    if (!fact_has_context(fact)) {
        return false;  // Return false if the context is invalid
    }

    // Determine the appropriate module or function based on the context
    if (fact->context == "zeta_trm") {
        // Route to ZetaTRM initialization or processing
        zeta_trm->process_fact(fact);
    } else if (fact->context == "zeta_dual_ctx") {
        // Route to ZetaHRM dual context initialization or processing
        zeta_dual_ctx->process_fact(fact);
    } else {
        // Default handling or error case
        return false;
    }

    return true;  // Success in routing the fact
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Validation**: The function `contextual_routing` first uses `fact_has_context` to ensure that the provided `fact` has a valid context.
2. **Routing Logic**: Based on the context value, it routes the fact to either `zeta_trm` or `zeta_dual_ctx` for further processing.
3. **Error Handling**: If the context is invalid or not recognized, it returns `false`, indicating a failure in routing.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Hybrid Model Integration**: If the system is using hybrid models, this function can be extended to dynamically select between different models based on contextual information.
- **Parallel Processing**: For performance optimization, this routing logic could be enhanced to use parallel processing techniques (e.g., threading) to handle multiple facts simultaneously.

By adding this `contextual_routing` function, we can significantly improve the system's ability to handle and process facts efficiently based on their contextual attributes, enhancing both performance and reliability.

### Example Usage:
```cpp
fact_t fact;
// Populate the fact with necessary data
