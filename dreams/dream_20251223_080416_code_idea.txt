 what would you do? How would you do it?
Given the recent interactions and the focus on improving various aspects of a system (likely related to HRM and TRM modules, among others), one useful insight is to integrate a machine learning-based model selection mechanism with contextual awareness for routing. This can significantly enhance the system's adaptability and efficiency.

### Specific Idea: Contextual-aware ML-based Model Selection with Routing

#### Overview:
Implement a hybrid model that dynamically selects the best-suited model (between 7B and 14B models) based on the context and input data. This would involve:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: Analyze the context of the input data to determine which model is more suitable.
2. **Model Selection**: Use a ML-based model selection algorithm to choose between the 7B and 14B models.
3. **Routing Mechanism**: Route the input data to the selected model for processing.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Extract features from the input data that are indicative of the context (e.g., type of information, domain-specific keywords).

2. **Training a Selection Model**:
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., a decision tree, SVM, or neural network) to predict which model (7B or 14B) would perform better based on the extracted features.
    - Use a labeled dataset where each entry includes input features and the performance of both models.

3. **Contextual-aware Routing**:
    - Implement a function that takes the input data and first passes it through the feature extraction process.
    - Use the trained ML model to predict the best model to use based on the extracted features.
    - Route the input data to the selected model for further processing.

#### Code Example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Mock dataset (for training purposes)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 5)  # Features
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Labels: 0 for 7B model, 1 for 14B model

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier for model selection
model_selector = RandomForestClassifier()
model_selector.fit
