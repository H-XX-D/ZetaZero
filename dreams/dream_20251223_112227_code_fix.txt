 Reflect on the structure and data handling.
Reflect on recent developments, and offer a unique perspective.

Sure, let's delve into a novel aspect of the codebase that focuses on the structure and data handling. One interesting avenue to explore is the integration of a more sophisticated error-handling mechanism that can provide context-aware feedback to users. This would enhance the user experience by giving them meaningful insights when something goes wrong.

### Insight: Context-Aware Error Handling

**Problem:** The current implementation of `g_zeta_embed_text` ensures that the input text is not null, but it lacks a robust error-handling system that can provide detailed information about why an error occurred. This could be improved by integrating a context-aware error-handling mechanism.

**Solution:**

1. **Exception Types:** Introduce custom exception types that capture various failure modes of the embedding process. For instance:
   - `TextNullException`: Thrown when the input text is null.
   - `DimensionMismatchException`: Thrown when the specified embedding dimension does not match expected constraints.
   - `EmbeddingFailureException`: Thrown when the embedding process fails for other reasons.

2. **Detailed Error Messages:** Each exception should include detailed error messages that explain what went wrong and, if possible, suggest potential solutions or next steps for users.

3. **Logging Mechanism:** Implement a logging mechanism that records errors along with timestamps and additional context (e.g., user ID, session ID) to help diagnose issues post-facto.

4. **User Feedback:** Modify the function to return an `ErrorInfo` object instead of a simple boolean success/failure indicator. This object would contain detailed information about any errors encountered during the embedding process.

**Example Code Improvement:**

```cpp
struct ErrorInfo {
    bool success;
    std::string message;
    std::string detailed_info;
    std::string suggested_action;
};

class EmbeddingException : public std::exception {
protected:
    std::string message_;
public:
    EmbeddingException(const std::string& msg) : message_(msg) {}
    virtual const char* what() const throw() {
        return message_.c_str();
    }
};

class TextNullException : public EmbeddingException {
public:
    TextNullException(const std::string& input_text) : EmbeddingException("Input text is null") {
        detailed_info_ = "The provided input text is null.";
        suggested_action_ = "Please ensure that you are passing a valid non-null text string.";
    }
};
