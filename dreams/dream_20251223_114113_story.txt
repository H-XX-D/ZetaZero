### Dynamic Model Profiling and Adaptive Routing

**Idea: Implementing Dynamic Model Profiling for Adaptive Routing**

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, the ZetaDynamicRouter statically routes tasks to specific models (e.g., 4B for embedding tasks, 14B for complex reasoning tasks) based on predefined rules. However, this static approach may not always be optimal, especially as new data and queries come in with varying characteristics and requirements.

**Solution:**
Introduce a mechanism to dynamically profile the incoming tasks and adaptively route them to the most suitable model based on real-time performance metrics. This would involve:

1. **Real-Time Performance Metrics Collection:** Each model should collect performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, accuracy) for each task it processes. These metrics would be used to assess the current workload's suitability for each model.

2. **Dynamic Task Profiling:** As a task arrives, it should be briefly analyzed by an initial profiling module to determine its complexity and resource requirements. This could be achieved by using a lightweight pre-processing step or by leveraging existing features in `g_zeta_embed_text` to extract key characteristics of the task.

3. **Adaptive Routing Algorithm:** Based on both the real-time performance metrics and the dynamic task profiling, an adaptive routing algorithm would decide which model is best suited to handle the incoming task. For instance:
    - If a task is highly computational and time-sensitive, it might get routed to a more powerful model.
    - Conversely, if a task is less computationally intensive but requires high accuracy, it might be routed to a more specialized model optimized for that type of query.

4. **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback loop where the system continuously learns from its routing decisions and adjusts its profiling parameters over time, ensuring long-term optimization.

**Example Workflow:**
- A complex reasoning query arrives.
- The profiling module quickly assesses the query and categorizes it as resource-intensive and accuracy-sensitive.
- The system checks the current performance metrics of all available models (e.g., 4B, 14B) to see which one is currently handling similar tasks efficiently.
- If the 14B model is currently underutilized and showing high accuracy rates, it gets selected. Otherwise, if another model (e
