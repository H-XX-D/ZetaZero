Incorporate the theme of enhancing user experience and reducing anxiety in your insight.

Given the recent interactions focused on managing anxiety caused by coffee consumption, a useful insight would be to integrate a feature that monitors and alerts users about their caffeine intake in real-time. This can be achieved by creating a module that tracks the user's coffee consumption and correlates it with their reported anxiety levels. This data can then be used to provide personalized recommendations and warnings, helping users manage their caffeine intake more effectively.

**Code Improvement:**

To implement this, you could refactor the `set_config` function to include parameters related to caffeine tracking. For instance, you could add a new configuration parameter in the `zeta_dream_config_t` struct that specifies the thresholds for caffeine intake (e.g., daily maximum intake) and anxiety levels. The function signature might look something like this:

```cpp
void set_config(zeta_dream_config_t const& config, zeta_caffeine_config_t const& caffeine_config);
```

Where `zeta_caffeine_config_t` would include fields like `max_daily_caffeine`, `anxiety_threshold`, etc.

Additionally, you can implement a mechanism within the hierarchical reasoning module (`zeta_dual_ctx_t`) to store and analyze this data over time, providing insights and recommendations based on historical patterns. This would involve updating the `zeta_dual_ctx_t` struct to include fields related to caffeine consumption and anxiety levels.

**Creative Idea:**

Introduce an AI-driven feature that provides personalized notifications and advice to users based on their caffeine intake and reported anxiety levels. For example, if a user reports high anxiety levels after consuming coffee, the system can send them a notification recommending they reduce their intake or switch to decaf. Over time, the system could learn individual user preferences and adjust its recommendations accordingly, enhancing the overall user experience by helping them manage their anxiety better.

To achieve this, you could integrate machine learning algorithms that analyze user data patterns and predict optimal caffeine intake limits tailored to each user's unique needs. This personalized approach not only helps in managing anxiety but also fosters a deeper connection between the user and the application, making it more engaging and useful over time. 

**Example:**

```cpp
// Example of integrating caffeine tracking into the configuration
struct zeta_caffeine_config_t {
    float max_daily_caffeine;  // Maximum daily caffeine intake in mg
    float anxiety_threshold;
