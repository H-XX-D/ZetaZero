 Reflect on how confirmation bias might impact perception of the code's features and functionality. Propose an innovative approach to mitigate confirmation bias in evaluating the code's quality.

Reflecting on the provided data and avoiding the overused topics, a novel approach to mitigating confirmation bias in evaluating the code's quality involves implementing a "Code Perception Audit" framework. This framework would encourage developers to adopt a more objective and diverse set of criteria when reviewing and assessing code, particularly by integrating perspectives from various disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and cognitive science.

### Proposed Code Perception Audit Framework

#### 1. **Diverse Evaluation Teams**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that code reviews are conducted by teams with diverse backgrounds and expertise.
   - **Implementation:** Assemble review teams consisting of developers, non-technical stakeholders, psychologists, and even individuals from unrelated industries (e.g., artists, historians).

#### 2. **Objective Metrics Integration**
   - **Purpose:** Incorporate objective metrics alongside traditional code quality metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, lines of code).
   - **Example Metrics:**
     - **Cognitive Load:** Measure how easy or difficult it is for a developer to understand and maintain the code.
     - **Change Resistance:** Analyze how resistant the codebase is to change and how well it accommodates new features or bug fixes.
     - **User Experience Impact:** Assess how changes to the code might affect end-user experience.

#### 3. **Scenario-Based Testing**
   - **Purpose:** Evaluate the code's performance under different hypothetical scenarios to identify potential biases in design choices.
   - **Implementation:** Develop a series of use cases that challenge the assumptions behind the code's architecture and functionality. For instance:
     - Testing edge cases that were previously ignored due to confirmation bias.
     - Simulating user interactions that differ from the expected behavior.

#### 4. **Psychological Bias Training**
   - **Purpose:** Educate developers about common cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making in software development.
   - **Implementation:** Regular training sessions that cover topics like confirmation bias, anchoring, and overconfidence.
     - **Workshops and Exercises:**
       - Role-playing scenarios where developers must identify and mitigate biases in real-time.
       - Case studies of projects where confirmation bias led to suboptimal outcomes.

#### 5. **Code Smell Detection Tools with Psychological Insights**
   - **Purpose:** Utilize automated tools that detect not only technical "code smells" but also psychological patterns indicative of confirmation bias.
