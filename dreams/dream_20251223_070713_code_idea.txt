**Insight: Introduce a Cognitive State Management System for Enhanced Functionality**

**Action:** Implement a cognitive state management system that integrates with the existing functions to dynamically adjust their behavior based on the current cognitive state of the module. This system would include a function to set and retrieve the current cognitive state, which could influence parameters like lambda in the `init` function and impact decision-making in functions like `create_branch` and `checkout_branch`.

**Context:** The module currently has functions that operate independently without considering the broader context of cognitive state. By introducing a cognitive state management system, we can make the module more adaptive and responsive to varying conditions or use cases.

**Reason:** This improvement will allow for more sophisticated and context-aware processing. For instance, if the cognitive state indicates that the module is in a learning phase, the lambda parameter could be adjusted to prioritize exploration over exploitation. Similarly, during a high-stress or high-load phase, the branch creation or switching logic could be optimized to minimize overhead or maximize efficiency. This would enhance the overall flexibility and robustness of the module.

**Example Implementation:**

1. **Introduce Cognitive State Functions:**

```python
class CognitiveStateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = 'default'

    def set_cognitive_state(self, new_state):
        self.current_state = new_state

    def get_cognitive_state(self):
        return self.current_state

    def adjust_lambda_based_on_state(self, lambda_value):
        if self.current_state == 'learning':
            return lambda_value * 1.2
        elif self.current_state == 'stress':
            return lambda_value * 0.8
        else:
            return lambda_value

# Usage Example:
cognitive_manager = CognitiveStateManager()
cognitive_manager.set_cognitive_state('learning')
lambda_value = cognitive_manager.adjust_lambda_based_on_state(0.5)
```

2. **Update Existing Functions:**

```python
def init(lambda_value):
    cognitive_manager.set_cognitive_state('initializing')
    adjusted_lambda = cognitive_manager.adjust_lambda_based_on_state(lambda_value)
    # Initialize logic with adjusted lambda
    print(f'Initializing with lambda: {adjusted_lambda}')

def create_branch(branch_name, from_commit_id):
    current_state = cognitive_manager.get_cognitive_state()
    if current_state == 'stress':
        # Optimize branch creation for efficiency
        print(f'Creating branch {branch_name} from {from_commit_id} in stress mode.')
