 To generate a novel insight or improvement related to the provided interactions, let's focus on an underexplored aspect: the integration of environmental context-awareness within the ZetaDynamicRouter system. Here's a specific idea:

### Environmental Context-Aware Task Prioritization

**Idea Overview:**
Integrate an environmental context-aware mechanism that adjusts task prioritization based on external factors such as user location, time of day, and system resource availability. This approach can enhance the system's adaptability and responsiveness.

**Detailed Proposal:**

1. **Environmental Context Sensors:**
   - **Location Sensing:** Utilize GPS or network-based location services to determine the user's physical location.
   - **Time Sensing:** Capture the current time and date to understand patterns related to time-specific tasks (e.g., meeting notifications during business hours).
   - **System Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage, memory availability, and network latency to gauge system health.

2. **Contextual Data Integration:**
   - Introduce a new function `g_zeta_get_context` which retrieves contextual data from sensors.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     struct ContextData {
         std::string location;
         std::time_t timestamp;
         float cpu_load;
         float memory_usage;
         float network_latency;
     };

     ContextData g_zeta_get_context();
     ```

3. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**
   - Modify the `ZetaDynamicRouter` to accept contextual data alongside task parameters.
   - Implement a priority adjustment algorithm based on context.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     enum TaskPriority { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH };

     TaskPriority g_zeta_adjust_priority(const ContextData& context, const Task& task) {
         if (context.cpu_load > 0.8 && task.type == "complex_reasoning") {
             return LOW; // Lower priority for resource-intensive tasks when system is busy
         }
         if (context.timestamp.hour >= 18 || context.timestamp.hour < 9) {
             return LOW; // Lower priority for non-urgent tasks outside business hours
         }
         return MEDIUM; // Default to medium priority
     }
     ```

4. **Enhanced Query Routing Logic:**
   - Update the routing logic in `ZetaDynamicRouter` to consider the adjusted task priority before determining the best model.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     void g_zeta_route_task(const Task& task, const ContextData& context) {
         TaskPriority priority =
