 Do NOT diverge to other ideas.
To design a concrete framework for the "Confirmation Bias Compass," we need to define the key components, data flows, and interfaces that will make this tool effective and user-friendly. The goal is to create a real-time analysis system that helps users recognize and mitigate their confirmation biases.

### Framework Overview
The Confirmation Bias Compass will have the following main components:
1. **Data Collection Module**
2. **Bias Detection Engine**
3. **Feedback Interface**
4. **Personalized Learning Module**
5. **User Dashboard**

### 1. Data Collection Module
**Components:**
- **Web Browser Integration:** Captures search history, clicked links, time spent on pages, etc.
- **Social Media API Integration:** Tracks interactions, shared posts, likes, comments, etc.
- **Reading Habits Tracker:** Monitors articles, books, and other reading materials.
- **User Input Form:** Allows users to manually input their thoughts or concerns.

**Data Flow:**
- Data from various sources (web browser, social media, reading habits) is collected in real-time and stored in a database.
- Manual user inputs are also recorded.

### 2. Bias Detection Engine
**Components:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) System:** Analyzes the text and context of interactions.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trains on labeled datasets to detect patterns indicative of confirmation bias.
- **Pattern Recognition Algorithms:** Identifies repetitive behaviors or preferences that align with confirmation bias.

**Data Flow:**
- Collected data is processed through the NLP system to extract meaningful insights.
- Machine learning models analyze the extracted insights to detect potential biases.
- Detected biases are flagged and categorized for further analysis.

### 3. Feedback Interface
**Components:**
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Notify users when they encounter potential confirmation bias situations.
- **Explanation Section:** Provides a brief explanation of why the detected behavior might be biased.
- **Suggestions for Mitigation:** Offers recommendations on how to seek out opposing viewpoints or diverse information sources.

**Data Flow:**
- The Bias Detection Engine sends alerts to the Feedback Interface based on real-time analysis.
- Users receive notifications with explanations and suggestions through the app interface.

### 4. Personalized Learning Module
**Components:**
- **Learning Recommendations:** Suggests articles, videos, or books that challenge the user's current beliefs.
- **Quiz & Exercises:** Engages users in activities designed to enhance critical thinking and awareness.
- **Progress Tracking:** Records
