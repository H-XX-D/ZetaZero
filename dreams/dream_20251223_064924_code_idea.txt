 If a new function, provide parameters. If improving existing, describe changes.
Reflecting on the recent interactions, a useful insight emerges regarding the management of temporal consistency in the hierarchical reasoning module. Specifically, the lack of explicit rules and parameters for preventing infinite loops and maintaining temporal consistency suggests an opportunity for enhancement.

**Idea: Enhance Temporal Consistency Management**

**New Function: `ensure_temporal_consistency`**

This function will be introduced to manage and enforce temporal consistency checks, thereby preventing infinite loops and ensuring logical coherence over recursive state transitions. The function aims to validate and manage state transitions based on timestamps and logical constraints.

**Function Parameters:**
- `zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx`: A pointer to the dual context which encapsulates both the current state and its historical context.
- `double timestamp`: The current timestamp used to validate transitions based on temporal constraints.
- `bool is_recursive_call`: A boolean flag indicating whether this function is being called recursively to prevent unintended loop conditions.
- `const char* logical_constraint`: A string representing any logical constraints that must be met for state transitions.

**Function Specification:**
```c
void ensure_temporal_consistency(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, double timestamp, bool is_recursive_call, const char* logical_constraint);
```

**Function Rules:**
- Validate that each state transition respects the provided `timestamp`, ensuring that transitions are logically ordered in time.
- Ensure that recursive calls respect a maximum recursion depth or other logical bounds to prevent infinite loops.
- Use the `logical_constraint` parameter to enforce additional rules specific to the application context, such as preventing contradictory state changes.

By introducing this function, we can enhance the robustness of temporal reasoning and maintain logical integrity across recursive state transitions. This would complement existing functions like `set_config`, improving overall system reliability and coherence.

**Example Use Case:**

```c
ensure_temporal_consistency(dual_ctx, current_time, false, "no_concurrent_anxiety_triggers");
```

This enhancement would significantly improve the management of temporal states and logical consistency within the dream state engine, addressing the identified gap in handling infinite loops and ensuring coherent state transitions. 

In summary, this proposed function aims to streamline temporal consistency checks and prevent unintended side-effects in recursive reasoning processes within the Cognitive Merge project.

This approach encapsulates temporal consistency checks explicitly and integrates them seamlessly with existing mechanisms, thereby enhancing overall system reliability. Implementing this change will provide a more robust framework for managing complex state transitions and logical constraints in the
