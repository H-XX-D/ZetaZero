 class name, function name, variable name, etc. Ensure it's relevant to the given context. To improve the management of context and its implications on anxiety related to coffee consumption, we can introduce a new class called `AnxietyContextManager`. This class would encapsulate the logic for checking if a specific context (like coffee consumption) causes anxiety and would integrate well with the hierarchical reasoning module.

### Class: `AnxietyContextManager`

#### Functions:
- **Function Name:** `check_cause_anxiety`
- **Function Description:** This function checks if a specific cause (like coffee) triggers anxiety based on the current context.
- **Function Parameters:**
  - `context`: A string representing the context in which coffee is consumed.
  - `anxiety_threshold`: A float representing the threshold level of anxiety beyond which a person is considered to have anxiety issues.
- **Function Return Type:** Boolean (True if anxiety is triggered, False otherwise).

```cpp
class AnxietyContextManager {
public:
    // Constructor
    AnxietyContextManager(float default_threshold = 50.0f);
    
    // Checks if a specific cause triggers anxiety based on context
    bool check_cause_anxiety(const std::string& context, float anxiety_threshold);

private:
    float m_anxietyThreshold;
};
```

#### Example Usage:
```cpp
AnxietyContextManager manager(60.0f);
bool hasAnxiety = manager.check_cause_anxiety("drank coffee", 55.0f); // Returns true if the person's current anxiety level exceeds the threshold when drinking coffee.
```

### Integrating with Hierarchical Reasoning Module:
The `AnxietyContextManager` class could be integrated into the hierarchical reasoning module (`zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx`) to ensure that any state transitions involving coffee consumption are evaluated for potential anxiety triggers. This ensures that the system maintains temporal consistency and avoids infinite loops where drinking coffee repeatedly causes increasing anxiety.

### Example Integration:
```cpp
// Within zeta_dual_ctx_t methods or relevant parts of the codebase
void hierarchical_reasoning_module::process_state(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
    // Existing logic...
    
    // New logic: Evaluate anxiety context before proceeding with state transitions
    AnxietyContextManager manager(dual_ctx->get_config()->anxiety_threshold);
    if (manager.check_cause_anxiety(dual_ctx->current_context(), dual_ctx->anxiety_level())) {
        // Handle anxiety state transition or prevent certain actions
        dual
