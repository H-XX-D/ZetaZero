From the interactions provided, one useful insight pertains to optimizing the routing logic of the ZetaDynamicRouter. Specifically, the system's current routing strategy for embedding tasks to the 4B model and complex reasoning tasks to the 14B model seems efficient, but there's an opportunity to enhance it further by incorporating context-aware routing.

**Context-Aware Routing Enhancement:**

**Idea:** Implement a mechanism within `ZetaDynamicRouter` to evaluate additional contextual information (e.g., user intent, query complexity beyond basic keywords) before routing a query. This could be achieved through a preliminary NLP analysis or a decision tree-based approach that dynamically assesses task characteristics.

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **Pre-Processing Layer:** Introduce a pre-processing module in `ZetaDynamicRouter` that analyzes the input query for nuanced details such as:
   - **User Intent Identification:** Use an Intent Recognition Model to determine the user's goal from the query.
   - **Task Complexity Assessment:** Employ a trained model to gauge the complexity of the task based on factors like sentence structure, entity recognition, and logical depth.

2. **Decision Tree for Contextual Routing:** Develop a decision tree that takes into account not just task type but also intent and complexity. This could look something like:

```python
def route_query(query):
    # Pre-processing steps
    intent = recognize_intent(query)
    complexity = assess_complexity(query)
    
    # Decision logic
    if intent == "code-related":
        return 7B_Coder
    elif complexity < threshold_low:
        return 4B_model
    elif complexity >= threshold_high:
        return 14B_model
    else:
        # Fallback to current strategy or hybrid model if available
        return fallback_routing(query)
```

3. **Fallback Mechanism:** Ensure there's a fallback mechanism in place to handle cases where context analysis is inconclusive or uncertain, ensuring robustness.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario where a user asks, "Can you generate a complex SQL query for me?" The pre-processing layer would recognize this as a code-related intent and high complexity due to the intricacy implied by "complex". Thus, it would route this to the 7B_Coder model directly, bypassing the need for initial assessment by the 14B model.

This enhancement would not only improve the efficiency of resource allocation but also ensure that tasks are routed to models best suited to handle them
