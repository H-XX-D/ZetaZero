**Insight:**

Social media platforms often exacerbate confirmation bias through their algorithms, creating echo chambers where users predominantly encounter content that aligns with their existing beliefs. However, an innovative solution could be to develop a feature that periodically exposes users to curated content from diverse viewpoints, thereby challenging their biases and fostering a more informed and balanced perspective. This feature could work as follows:

1. **Diverse Content Curator:** The platform would integrate an AI system designed to identify a user's current information consumption patterns and interests based on their social media activity, search history, and interactions.
   
2. **Algorithmic Challenge:** The system would then select a small percentage of content from verified sources that represent opposing or alternative viewpoints on topics the user frequently engages with. This content would be clearly labeled as part of the "Challenge Your Bias" initiative.

3. **Educational Feedback Loop:** Alongside the presented content, the platform would include brief summaries explaining why the opposing viewpoint exists and what evidence supports it. Additionally, users would be encouraged to leave anonymous feedback about the experience and suggest ways to improve the feature.

4. **Progressive Exposure:** Over time, the frequency of presented challenging content could be gradually increased to help users adapt to considering diverse viewpoints without overwhelming them.

5. **Privacy and Transparency:** Users would have the option to opt-out of this feature entirely but would be informed of its potential benefits. The feature would operate with strict privacy controls, ensuring that exposure is based on aggregated data rather than individual user information.

6. **Collaboration with Fact-Checkers:** To maintain credibility and accuracy, this feature would collaborate with reputable fact-checking organizations to verify the accuracy of all presented content, ensuring that users are not exposed to misinformation under the guise of challenging bias.

7. **Research Integration:** The platform could partner with academic institutions to continuously research and refine the effectiveness of this feature in reducing confirmation bias and promoting balanced information consumption.

By implementing such a feature, social media platforms can play a proactive role in combating the echo chamber effect and promoting a more nuanced understanding of complex issues among their users. This approach leverages technology to directly address a significant social issue while respecting user autonomy and privacy concerns. 

**Code Improvement:**

To implement the "Challenge Your Bias" feature, you could create a Python function within the social media platform's backend that periodically evaluates user activity and selects appropriate content for exposure:

```python
import random
import requests

def challenge_bias(user_id):
    # Fetch user's
