 what code to change/add, or a process improvement, or architectural change to implement. Make it practical and valuable. Aim for something impactful that could noticeably enhance the system's efficiency, performance, or maintainability.
Based on the recent interactions and the identified areas of improvement, a practical and impactful enhancement would be to implement a **hybrid model selection mechanism** that dynamically selects between different models based on the input data characteristics. This can significantly enhance the system's efficiency and performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

### Specific Implementation Plan:

1. **Introduce a Context-Aware Model Selector:**
   - Create a new class/module `ModelSelector` that takes input data and context as parameters.
   - This selector will analyze the input data characteristics and decide which model (e.g., 7B, 14B) is best suited for the task.

2. **Dynamic Model Initialization:**
   - Modify the initialization functions (`name`, `fact_has_context`, etc.) to accept an additional parameter for specifying the model type.
   - For example:
     ```c
     void initialize_zetahrm(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, int model_type);
     void initialize_zetatrmm(float lambda = TRM_DEFAULT_LAMBDA, int model_type = DEFAULT_MODEL);
     ```

3. **Model Execution Based on Selection:**
   - The `ModelSelector` will return the chosen model type.
   - The initialization functions will use this model type to dynamically initialize the appropriate model.
   - Example:
     ```c
     void initialize_system() {
         zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx = get_dual_context();
         int selected_model_type = ModelSelector::select_model(dual_ctx);
         initialize_zetahrm(dual_ctx, selected_model_type);
         initialize_zetatrmm(TRM_DEFAULT_LAMBDA, selected_model_type);
     }
     ```

4. **Performance Metrics and Feedback Loop:**
   - Implement performance metrics to monitor the efficiency and accuracy of each model during runtime.
   - Use these metrics to refine the `ModelSelector` over time, improving its accuracy in selecting the best model.

### Code Example:

```cpp
class ModelSelector {
public:
    static int select_model(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx) {
        // Analyze dual_ctx and return the best model type (7B or 14B)
        // Example logic:
        if (dual_ctx->is_large_dataset) {
            return 14B; // Choose
