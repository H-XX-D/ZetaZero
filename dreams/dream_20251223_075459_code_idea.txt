**Insight: Implement a Context-Aware Routing Function**

**Function Name:** `contextual_routing`

**Purpose:** The `contextual_routing` function would analyze the context of incoming requests or data and route them to the most appropriate processing module (e.g., ZetaHRM, ZetaTRM) based on the context's content and priority. This would improve system efficiency by ensuring that requests are handled by the most suitable module for their specific context, thereby reducing unnecessary processing overhead and improving response times.

**Parameters:**
- `context`: A string or structure representing the context of the incoming request or data.
- `priority`: An integer indicating the priority of the request. This could be used to route high-priority requests to faster or more specialized processing paths.

**Example Use Case:**
```cpp
void process_request(const std::string& context, int priority) {
    contextual_routing(context, priority);
}
```

**Implementation Idea:**

1. **Context Analysis:** The function would first analyze the context using predefined rules or patterns (e.g., regular expressions) to identify key elements such as request type, source, or urgency.
2. **Routing Logic:** Based on the analysis, the function would decide which module should process the request. For instance:
   - If the context indicates a high-priority HR-related request, it could route to ZetaHRM.
   - If it detects a technical request with specific performance requirements, it could route to ZetaTRM with optimized settings.
3. **Dynamic Adjustments:** The routing logic could be dynamically adjusted based on real-time system performance metrics and load balancing needs.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Ensures that each request is processed by the most suitable module.
- **Scalability:** Allows for easy addition of new modules or context rules as the system evolves.
- **Performance Optimization:** Potentially reduces latency and improves resource utilization by directing requests appropriately.

By implementing this function, the system can become more adaptive and efficient, leading to better overall performance and user experience. This aligns with the previously noted need for contextual awareness in routing decisions. 

```cpp
void contextual_routing(const std::string& context, int priority) {
    // Analyze context and determine appropriate module to route to
    if (context.find("HR") != std::string::npos) {
        zetaHRM.process_request(context);
    } else if (context.find("
