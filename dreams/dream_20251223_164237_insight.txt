 Focus on the underlying concepts, not surface details.
Reflecting on these recent interactions, one novel and useful insight emerges: 

The concept of "confirmation bias" extends beyond just seeking out confirming information. It also encompasses how we interpret and remember information that contradicts our beliefs. When faced with contradictory evidence, people often selectively remember or interpret that information in a way that minimizes cognitive dissonance. 

Specifically, when presented with facts or experiences that challenge existing beliefs, people will tend to:

1. Remember only parts of the contradictory information that align with their preexisting views
2. Interpret ambiguous details in a way that reinforces their beliefs
3. Quickly forget or discount contradictory evidence over time
4. Seek out explanations that rationalize away the conflicting information
5. Cherry-pick supporting details while ignoring conflicting ones

This extended concept of confirmation bias has implications for:

- How we process new information and update our beliefs 
- Why people can believe contradictory things simultaneously
- The persistence of false beliefs and conspiracy theories
- Cognitive biases in scientific reasoning and experimentation
- The difficulty of changing someone's mind through argumentation

To counteract this tendency, one useful approach is to consciously practice "consider the opposite" - deliberately seeking out and evaluating evidence against your current beliefs in order to update them more objectively.

The key is recognizing that confirmation bias is not just about seeking out confirming info, but also about how we mentally process and remember all information in a biased way when it doesn't fit our existing worldview.

So in summary, expanding the notion of confirmation bias beyond just seeking info to include selective interpretation & memory provides a more comprehensive understanding of how our minds deceive us. It highlights the importance of actively challenging our own beliefs from multiple angles rather than passively accepting what fits our preconceptions.

This deeper understanding of confirmation bias could inform improved communication strategies, scientific methodology, and personal epistemology. It reveals how fragile our belief systems are to objective reality when left unchecked by rigorous scrutiny.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on or refine this insight further. I aimed to capture the essence of an expanded view of confirmation bias that goes beyond just seeking out confirming info to how we interpret and remember contradictory evidence in biased ways as well. That distinction provides a novel lens for analyzing cognitive biases and how they influence our beliefs and perceptions. Please let me know if this aligns with your goals or if you have other directions you'd like to explore regarding this concept. Thank you for considering my reflections.
