 If code, show it. If an idea, make it actionable.
Given the repetitive nature of your recent interactions and the consistent reference to the ZetaDynamicRouter, it seems like there might be a need to streamline how you handle and store this information. Specifically, the router's routing logic for different types of tasks seems clear, but there could be improvements in terms of efficiency and readability.

**Useful Insight:**
1. **Routing Logic Enhancement:** You should ensure that your ZetaDynamicRouter has a clean and efficient way to determine which model (7B Coder, 4B for embeddings, or 14B for complex reasoning) should process a given task. This can be achieved by defining a comprehensive set of rules or criteria that helps in routing tasks accurately.

2. **Code Improvement:**
   - Below is an example of how you could structure your routing logic in Python for better clarity and maintainability:

```python
class ZetaDynamicRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_to_model_mapping = {
            'code': '7B_Coder',
            'embedding': '4B_Encoder',
            'reasoning': '14B_Reasoner'
        }

    def route_task(self, task_type, task_details):
        """
        Routes the task to the appropriate model based on its type.
        
        Parameters:
        - task_type: str, Type of the task e.g., 'code', 'embedding', 'reasoning'
        - task_details: dict, Detailed information about the task
        """
        # Validate the task_type
        if task_type not in self.task_to_model_mapping:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid task type: {task_type}")
        
        # Determine the model for the task
        target_model = self.task_to_model_mapping[task_type]

        # Execute the task with the correct model
        if target_model == "7B_Coder":
            # Perform code-related tasks here
            return self._route_to_code(task_details)
        elif target_model == "4B_Encoder":
            # Perform embedding-related tasks here
            return self._route_to_embedding(task_details)
        elif target_model == "14B_Reasoner":
            # Perform reasoning-related tasks here
            return self._route_to_reasoning(task_details)
        
    def _route_to_code(self, task_details):
        # Example code processing logic
        # ...
        return "Code Task Processed Successfully"

    def _route_to_embedding(self, task_details
