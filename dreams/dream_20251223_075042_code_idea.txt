 provide a function name, parameter names/types, and a brief description of the desired functionality.
**Insight: Hybrid Model Selection Based on Contextual Awareness**

### Function Name: `select_model_based_on_context`
### Parameters:
- `zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx`: A pointer to the dual context.
- `zeta_system_state_t system_state`: The current state of the system, including resource availability and performance metrics.

### Description:
This function will dynamically select between different models (e.g., 7B, 14B, hybrid models) based on the contextual information available in the dual context and the current system state. The goal is to optimize performance and resource usage by choosing the most appropriate model for the given context.

### Example Function Signature:
```c
model_type_t select_model_based_on_context(zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, zeta_system_state_t system_state);
```

### Desired Functionality:
1. **Context Analysis**: Analyze the dual context to determine if there is any specific requirement or preference for a particular model (e.g., more memory-efficient, higher accuracy, etc.).
2. **System State Evaluation**: Evaluate the current system state to understand resource availability (e.g., CPU load, memory usage) and performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput).
3. **Model Selection**: Based on the analysis from both context and system state, dynamically select the most suitable model (e.g., 7B for lower resource environments or hybrid models for balanced performance).

### Example Usage:
```c
model_type_t selected_model = select_model_based_on_context(dual_ctx, system_state);
switch (selected_model) {
    case MODEL_7B:
        // Initialize and use 7B model
        break;
    case MODEL_14B:
        // Initialize and use 14B model
        break;
    case HYBRID_MODEL:
        // Initialize and use hybrid model
        break;
}
```

This approach enhances flexibility and adaptability, ensuring that the system can optimize its performance and resource usage based on real-time conditions. This could be particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic workload balancing and performance optimization are critical.

This function aims to encapsulate the logic for intelligent model selection, thereby improving the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the system. This is a step towards creating a more adaptive and efficient ZetaHRM/TRM framework.
