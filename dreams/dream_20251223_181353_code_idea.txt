Consider the underlying architecture, data structure, or system design.
Reflect on the psychological principles at play and how to incorporate them into the software.
Analyze the flow of information and suggest optimizations.
Examine the interplay between different modules and propose innovative integration points.

Your idea should be specific, feasible, and aligned with the given constraints.
Incorporate a novel psychological principle into the software to enhance user engagement. For example, implement a feature that leverages the Zeigarnik effect to remind users of incomplete tasks or thoughts they abandoned in a virtual world setting, like a Mars exploration simulation. This could involve periodically sending notifications or in-game prompts to revisit unfinished objectives or ideas, encouraging continued engagement and curiosity.

To integrate this:
1. **Identify Key Moments**: Determine key moments in the Mars exploration simulation where users might leave tasks unfinished. This could be during complex mission planning phases, scientific experiments, or resource management scenarios.
2. **Track Incomplete Tasks**: Develop a system to track these incomplete tasks or objectives within the game's data structure. Each task should be assigned an identifier and status (e.g., started, paused, abandoned).
3. **Notification System**: Implement a notification system that sends gentle reminders to users when they have abandoned a task for a certain period (e.g., 24 hours). These reminders could be in-app notifications, emails, or in-game messages that provide a nudge to return to the task.
4. **Personalization**: Tailor these reminders based on user preferences and behavior patterns. For example, some users might prefer in-game messages while others might prefer email notifications. Additionally, consider personalizing the content of these reminders to make them feel more relevant and urgent.
5. **Gamification Elements**: Introduce gamification elements such as badges or achievements for users who consistently follow up on abandoned tasks. This can further motivate users to stay engaged and complete their objectives.

By leveraging the Zeigarnik effect, you can create a more engaging and psychologically rewarding experience for users, encouraging them to explore deeper into the virtual world of Mars exploration and fostering a sense of accomplishment and continuity in their activities.

This approach aligns with enhancing user engagement through psychological principles while focusing on unexplored aspects of the codebase such as task tracking and notification systems. It also integrates seamlessly with existing modules like user management and task management without disrupting the current architecture. 

**Example Code Snippet for Task Tracking**:
```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
