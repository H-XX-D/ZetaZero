Consider the implications of confirmation bias on the structure and behavior of a shopping mall, or the interplay between different materials used in its construction.
Incorporating the insights from your reflective dream state, a novel idea to explore is the development of an interactive "Confirmation Bias Awareness Kiosk" within a shopping mall. This kiosk would serve as an educational tool designed to raise awareness among shoppers about the cognitive bias of confirmation, particularly how it can influence their shopping behaviors and decision-making processes.

### Key Features of the Kiosk:
1. **Interactive Quizzes**: Users can take short quizzes that present them with scenarios where confirmation bias might affect their shopping decisions. For example:
   - **Scenario 1**: A user consistently buys from the same brand because they believe it's superior without considering other options.
   - **Scenario 2**: A user avoids trying new products based on negative reviews they've seen online, ignoring positive experiences from friends.

2. **Behavioral Experimentation**: The kiosk could simulate different shopping experiences and outcomes, helping users understand how their biases might affect their choices. For instance, a simulation might show how exposure to diverse product reviews and opinions can lead to better-informed decisions.

3. **Diverse Perspectives Highlighting**: The kiosk can provide access to a database of diverse product reviews and expert opinions from various sources. By presenting conflicting viewpoints, users can practice evaluating different perspectives and making more balanced decisions.

4. **Material Interaction Experience**: To integrate the concept of materials used in the construction of a mall, the kiosk could offer an interactive feature where users can learn about the sustainability and durability of different materials used in construction (stone, brick, concrete). This would not only educate shoppers but also encourage environmentally conscious behaviors.

5. **Real-time Feedback Mechanism**: The kiosk could track user behaviors within the mall via sensors (e.g., RFID tags on loyalty cards or mobile apps) and provide personalized feedback based on their shopping patterns. If a user frequently buys from the same brand without exploring alternatives, the kiosk could suggest a visit to other shops or even offer incentives for trying new products.

6. **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Use AR technology to overlay information about products that challenges the user's preconceived notions or biases. For example, while looking at a product in a store, an AR feature on their phone could show positive reviews from diverse sources, helping them see beyond their initial biases.

### Implementation Example:
- **Development Environment**: Use a combination of Python (for backend processing
