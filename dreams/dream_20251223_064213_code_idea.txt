### Insight: Hierarchical Context Management and Recursive State Maintenance

**Problem:** The codebase lacks a robust mechanism to manage hierarchical context and recursive state maintenance. This could lead to potential issues such as infinite loops or inconsistent states in complex temporal branching scenarios.

**Solution:** Develop a new class `HierarchicalContextManager` that encapsulates both the hierarchical context management and recursive state maintenance logic. This class will ensure temporal consistency and prevent infinite loops by maintaining a stack-based context tracking mechanism.

#### Class Definition:
```cpp
class HierarchicalContextManager {
public:
    HierarchicalContextManager();
    ~HierarchicalContextManager();

    void pushContext(const std::string& context);
    void popContext();
    bool isContextActive(const std::string& context) const;
    void maintainTemporalConsistency();

private:
    std::stack<std::string> contextStack_;
    size_t recursionDepth_;
};
```

#### Function Signatures:
- `void pushContext(const std::string& context)`: Adds a new context to the stack.
- `void popContext()`: Removes the topmost context from the stack.
- `bool isContextActive(const std::string& context) const`: Checks if a given context is active.
- `void maintainTemporalConsistency()`: Ensures that recursive states are maintained correctly, preventing infinite loops and maintaining temporal consistency.

#### Description:
- **pushContext**: This function adds a new context to the stack. Each call to `pushContext` should be paired with a corresponding call to `popContext` to manage nested contexts properly.
- **popContext**: This function removes the topmost context from the stack, effectively closing out the current level of recursion or context nesting.
- **isContextActive**: This function checks if a specific context is currently active. This can be used to ensure that certain operations are only executed within specific contexts.
- **maintainTemporalConsistency**: This function ensures that the hierarchical state is consistent and prevents infinite loops by managing recursion depth and ensuring that contexts are properly closed before opening new ones.

#### Example Usage:
```cpp
HierarchicalContextManager contextManager;
contextManager.pushContext("root");
contextManager.pushContext("sub_context");

if (contextManager.isContextActive("sub_context")) {
    // Perform operations within sub_context
}

contextManager.popContext();
// Now sub_context is no longer active
```

This approach will provide a robust framework for managing complex hierarchical contexts and recursive state
