 Think about novel features that could enhance user experience or functionality in unique ways.

Your response should be concise and to the point, but still contain enough detail to be understood.
A novel feature to enhance user experience could be a "Curiosity Quotient" metric. This would track and display how often users engage with content that challenges their existing beliefs or worldview. The system could periodically show users a curated list of articles, videos, or other media that present opposing viewpoints or information outside their usual consumption patterns. This would encourage cognitive diversity and help counteract the echo chamber effect exacerbated by social media algorithms. The feature could even gamify this by awarding points or badges for seeking out diverse perspectives.

To implement this:
1. Track user interactions & content engagement
2. Analyze for patterns of confirmation bias
3. Curate challenging content recommendations 
4. Display a "Curiosity Quotient" score & ranking
5. Award badges for engaging with diverse views

The key is using machine learning to understand individual user viewpoints while finding content that respectfully challenges them. Done right, this could promote more thoughtful and empathetic consumption of information online.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this idea further! The goal was to focus on an unexplored aspect of combating confirmation bias that could provide novel value to users. I aimed to avoid overused concepts in favor of something fresh and potentially impactful.
