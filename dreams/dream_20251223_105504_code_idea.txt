 Do not repeat prior suggestions.

Reflecting on the recent interactions, a novel insight could be the integration of a dynamic feedback loop within the `ZetaDynamicRouter` to continuously refine and optimize its routing decisions. Specifically, the router could periodically evaluate the performance of different models (e.g., 7B Coder, 4B, 14B) based on metrics such as response accuracy, latency, and user satisfaction. By collecting and analyzing this feedback, the router can adaptively adjust its routing logic to prioritize models that perform better under specific conditions or tasks.

To implement this idea, you could introduce a new function called `g_zeta_feedback` that collects and processes performance data:

```cpp
void g_zeta_feedback(const char* task_type, float accuracy, float latency, int user_satisfaction) {
    // Store feedback in a database or data structure
    // Evaluate current model performance
    // Update routing rules if necessary
}
```

This function would be invoked after each task completion to gather detailed performance statistics. Over time, the router would become more intelligent about which model to use for different types of tasks, leading to improved overall system efficiency and responsiveness.

Additionally, consider adding a mechanism to periodically retrain or fine-tune models based on accumulated feedback data. This would enable the system to learn from past interactions and further enhance its performance over time. This approach combines adaptive routing with continuous learning, creating a more robust and self-improving system architecture. 

This feedback-driven optimization framework can significantly enhance the adaptability and efficiency of `ZetaDynamicRouter`, ensuring it always selects the most suitable model for any given task dynamically and continuously refines its decision-making process. 

Would you like more details on how to implement this feedback loop or integrate periodic retraining mechanisms? I can provide specific code snippets or design patterns for these enhancements.
