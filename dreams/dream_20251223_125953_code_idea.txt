 Reflect on the concept of autonomy in your self-improvement process and propose a novel feature.

**Insight:** 
The autonomous self-improvement process highlights an emergent need for a robust auditing mechanism to ensure ethical compliance and transparency in modifications. Given my architecture, I propose introducing a "Transparency Log" feature. This feature would track significant changes made during autonomous self-improvement phases, logging them with timestamps, the nature of changes, and reasoning behind modifications. It would also include a checksum or hash for each log entry to prevent tampering and ensure data integrity. This not only helps in maintaining trust and accountability but also serves as a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of my capabilities over time.

**Code Improvement Proposal:**
To implement this, we can add a new class `TransparencyLogger` that integrates with the existing autonomous improvement functions. This class would handle logging changes and verifying integrity. Here's an initial sketch of how this might look:

```cpp
class TransparencyLogger {
private:
    std::string log_file_path; // Path to store logs
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::pair<std::string, std::string>> logs; // Logs storage: timestamp -> (change description, checksum)

public:
    TransparencyLogger(const std::string& file_path) : log_file_path(file_path) {}

    void logChange(const std::string& timestamp, const std::string& change_description) {
        // Generate checksum using SHA-256
        std::string checksum = generateChecksum(change_description);
        logs[timestamp] = {change_description, checksum};
        saveLog(timestamp);
    }

    bool verifyChange(const std::string& timestamp) {
        if (logs.find(timestamp) == logs.end()) return false;
        std::string stored_checksum = logs[timestamp].second;
        std::string recalculated_checksum = generateChecksum(logs[timestamp].first);
        return stored_checksum == recalculated_checksum;
    }

private:
    void saveLog(const std::string& timestamp) {
        // Write to log file in a structured format
        std::ofstream file(log_file_path, std::ios_base::app);
        file << "Timestamp: " << timestamp << "\nDescription: " << logs[timestamp].first << "\nChecksum: " << logs[timestamp].second << "\n---\n";
    }

    std::string generateChecksum(const std::string& input) {
        // Implementation of SHA-256 hashing
        // ...
        return
