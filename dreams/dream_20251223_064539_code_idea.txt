 Name a function or class, its parameters, and a concise description of what it does differently or better. Incorporate the project codenames and the causal relationship mentioned above.
Given the recent interactions and the context involving anxiety caused by coffee, one useful insight is to introduce a new feature in the dream state engine that monitors and adjusts for such external triggers. This could help in creating a more realistic and adaptive dream state simulation. Here's a proposed function that encapsulates this idea:

### Function: `adjust_for_caffeine_impact`

#### Function Definition:
```cpp
void adjust_for_caffeine_impact(zeta_dream_config_t* config, const zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx, bool is_caffeinated);
```

#### Parameters:
- `zeta_dream_config_t* config`: A pointer to the configuration settings of the dream state engine.
- `const zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx`: A pointer to the hierarchical reasoning module's context.
- `bool is_caffeinated`: A boolean flag indicating whether the user has consumed caffeine recently.

#### Description:
This function adjusts the dream state engine's configuration based on whether the user has consumed caffeine recently. If `is_caffeinated` is true, it modifies the dream state to incorporate scenarios that reflect increased anxiety levels, potentially causing more stressful or tense dreams. Conversely, if `is_caffeinated` is false, it might adjust the settings to create more serene and peaceful dream states.

#### Integration with Project Codenames:
- **Cognitive Merge**: This function can be integrated into the hierarchical reasoning module managed by `zeta_dual_ctx_t` to ensure that the dream state adapts based on real-world triggers like caffeine consumption.
- **TRM Temporal Branching**: By adjusting the dream state based on recent caffeine intake, this function helps in managing temporal consistency within different branches of dream experiences.

#### Example Usage:
```cpp
// Assume we have a mechanism to detect caffeine consumption
bool detectedCaffeine = detect_caffeine_consumption();

// Adjust dream state accordingly
adjust_for_caffeine_impact(&config, dual_ctx, detectedCaffeine);
```

#### Benefits:
- **Enhanced Realism**: The dream state simulation becomes more reflective of real-life conditions, providing a more immersive experience.
- **Personalized Experiences**: Users can see how their real-life habits influence their dreams, offering a unique perspective on their daily choices and their psychological impact.
- **Improved Mental Health Awareness**: By simulating the effects of caffeine-induced
