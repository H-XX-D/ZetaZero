 Name the file, method, or class.

File: MemorySystemArchitecture.py

Method: integrateBranches()

Insight: The current implementation of the `integrateBranches()` method in the `MemorySystemArchitecture.py` file can be optimized to better handle the integration of parallel lines of development in the memory system. By incorporating a concept similar to Git's directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, we can improve how the system manages commits and merges.

**Proposed Enhancement:**

1. **Enhance Merge Strategy:**
   - Introduce a more sophisticated merge strategy that leverages conflict resolution techniques used in version control systems. This could involve implementing a three-way merge strategy (common base, local changes, and remote changes) to resolve conflicts intelligently.

2. **Improve Commit Handling:**
   - Ensure that each commit is tagged with a unique identifier and maintains links to its parent commits. This will facilitate easier tracking and merging of branches.

3. **Conflict Detection and Resolution:**
   - Implement a mechanism for detecting conflicts early and resolving them either automatically or through user intervention based on severity and complexity of the conflict.

4. **Graph-Based Conflict Resolution:**
   - Utilize a graph-based approach to visualize and resolve conflicts. This could involve visualizing the DAG structure to identify conflicting changes and their context within the overall memory architecture.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```python
class MemorySystemArchitecture:
    def integrateBranches(self, branch_a, branch_b):
        # Detect common base commit
        common_base = self.findCommonBase(branch_a, branch_b)

        # Merge local and remote changes
        merged_changes = self.mergeChanges(branch_a, branch_b, common_base)

        # Detect and resolve conflicts
        conflicts = self.detectConflicts(merged_changes)
        if conflicts:
            resolved_changes = self.resolveConflicts(conflicts)
        else:
            resolved_changes = merged_changes

        # Finalize integration
        return self.finalizeIntegration(resolved_changes)

    def findCommonBase(self, branch_a, branch_b):
        # Find the common base commit between two branches
        pass

    def mergeChanges(self, branch_a, branch_b, common_base):
        # Merge changes from two branches using a three-way merge strategy
        pass

    def detectConflicts(self, merged_changes):
        # Identify conflicting changes in the merged data
        pass

    def resolveConflicts(self, conflicts):
        # Resolve detected conflicts using a conflict resolution strategy
        pass
