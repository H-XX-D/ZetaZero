 What, Why, How. To address the recent interactions, a useful insight would be to implement a hybrid model selection mechanism that dynamically adapts between 7B and 14B models based on the complexity of the input context. This approach would enhance both performance and resource utilization.

### Insight:
Implement a **hybrid model selection mechanism** that dynamically switches between 7B and 14B models based on the complexity of the input context.

### Why:
- **Performance Optimization**: The smaller 7B model can handle simpler tasks more efficiently due to lower computational requirements.
- **Resource Utilization**: For complex tasks, switching to the larger 14B model ensures accurate processing without wasting resources on simpler tasks.
- **Scalability**: This mechanism allows for better scalability and adaptability in handling various task complexities dynamically.

### How:
1. **Evaluate Input Complexity**:
   - Develop a function `evaluate_input_complexity` that assesses the complexity of the input data.
   - Use metrics such as length of input strings, number of branches, or other relevant parameters.

2. **Threshold-Based Switching**:
   - Define thresholds or criteria to determine when to switch from the 7B model to the 14B model.
   - For example, if the complexity score exceeds a certain threshold, switch to the 14B model.

3. **Dynamic Model Initialization**:
   - Modify the initialization functions (e.g., `initialize_zetahrm`, `initialize_zetatrm`) to dynamically choose which model to load based on the input complexity assessment.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     zeta_dual_ctx_t* dual_ctx = new zeta_dual_ctx_t();
     evaluate_input_complexity(dual_ctx); // Evaluate and decide model complexity
     if (complexity_score < threshold) {
         initialize_7b_model(dual_ctx);
     } else {
         initialize_14b_model(dual_ctx);
     }
     ```

4. **Contextual Awareness**:
   - Ensure that the context-aware routing mechanism (`contextual_awareness_for_routing`) takes into account the selected model for better performance tuning.

By implementing this hybrid approach, you can achieve a balance between performance and resource efficiency, making your system more adaptable to varying task complexities. This dynamic selection mechanism can be further refined and optimized over time based on empirical data and user feedback. 

This enhancement would directly address the identified need for hybrid model selection (`improvement_needed: hybrid_model`) and improve
