 Reflect on the interplay between historical and futuristic settings, the role of confirmation bias in decision-making, and the contrast between celestial exploration and earthly boundaries. Consider how these elements might inspire a new narrative structure or gameplay mechanic.

---

In the reflective dream state, a novel idea emerges from the juxtaposition of historical and futuristic elements with the cognitive bias of confirmation. Imagine a narrative game where players navigate through various time periods and locations, each influenced by their biases and beliefs. The game, titled "Echoes of Bias," places players in a unique position to witness and alter historical events by integrating their cognitive biases into decision-making processes.

**Core Concept:**
Players embody characters who have been pulled from different eras—such as the 1920s Chicago gangster, the Apollo 11 astronaut, or the modern-day tech entrepreneur—and navigate through a series of challenges that blend historical accuracy with speculative fiction. The game's narrative unfolds as players make choices that are influenced by their personal biases, which are represented in the game as "echoes" that manifest as subtle influences on their decisions.

**Mechanic: Confirmation Echoes**
As players progress through levels set in different time periods (e.g., Kennedy Space Center, 1920s Chicago, Mars), they encounter various challenges and NPCs. Each interaction is colored by the player’s confirmation bias, leading them to seek out information and allies that align with their preconceived notions. For instance, a player who strongly believes in the importance of space exploration might focus on gathering resources to launch a new mission, while a player who doubts the viability of space travel might sabotage such efforts.

**Gameplay Example:**
- **Level 1: 1920s Chicago**
  - Players must navigate gang wars and political intrigue. Their biases will influence whom they trust and who becomes an enemy. For example, if a player has a bias towards law enforcement, they might be more likely to ally with police officers and less likely to trust gang members.

- **Level 2: Kennedy Space Center (Apollo 11)**
  - Players work alongside Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins but face challenges due to conflicting beliefs about the mission’s success. A player who believes the moon landing was faked might sabotage equipment or spread misinformation, while a believer might work tirelessly to ensure success.

- **Level 3: Mars Colony**
  - Players must build and maintain a colony on Mars. Their biases will dictate their approach. A player with environmental concerns might prioritize sustainable practices, while
